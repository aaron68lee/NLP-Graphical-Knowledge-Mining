# NLP-Topic-Modeling-of-Corpora

## Research Questions and Goals
Calculate similarity score between two documents
By using distance Fr√®chet Inception Distance from Word2Vec
Score after comparing two document summary generations
Pick k most similar documents 
Sentiment analysis on documents
Generation of similar text based on trained documents 
Experiment with n-grams
Create social graph between people mentioned in documents

## NLP Research Techniques
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
Word occurrence using tf-idf scheme
LSI dimension reduction singular value decomp of term-by-document matrix X
Alternative: pLSI aspect model
Above methods are flawed fundamentally, hence LDA method
Overfitting
Params is O(n) with words in document
No transfer learning

This is the research report on findings and specific techniques used over the duration of the project:
