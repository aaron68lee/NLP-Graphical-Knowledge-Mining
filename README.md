Research Paper:<br>
[NLP Methodologies for Integrated Graph-based Knowledge Extraction of Multilingual Large Scale Text Corpora](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rMXLpq-jAv0JNntelbfRGY327EllKOwhn4sazzjlIoU/edit?usp=sharing)

## Research Questions and Goals
Calculate similarity score between two documents
By using distance Fr√®chet Inception Distance from Word2Vec
Score after comparing two document summary generations
Generation of similar text based on trained documents 
Experiment with n-grams
Create social graph between people mentioned in documents

## NLP Research Techniques
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
Word occurrence using tf-idf scheme
LSI dimension reduction singular value decomposition of term-by-document matrix X
Alternative: pLSI aspect model
Above methods are flawed fundamentally, hence LDA method
