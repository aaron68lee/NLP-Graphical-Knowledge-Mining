No. 59. [2d Session. THE CREEKS. COMMUNICATED TO CONGRESS, JANUARY 12, 1795. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: I lay before Congress for their consideration, the copy of a letter from the Secretary of War, accompanied fcv an extract from a memorandum of James Seagrove, Agent of Indian affairs. , . GEO. WASHINGTON. United States, January 12/A, 1795. Department of War, December 31s/, 1791. Sir: I have the honor to enclose you the opinion of James Seagrove, agent for the Creek nation, upon the subject of the negroes which ought to have been returned in pursuance of the treaty of New York. I beg leave to add, that, if the United States deem it inexpedient to press for a return of the negroes, that it would appear proper that the owners should be compensated, conformably to some equitable principles to be devised. If this idea should be just, it would be proper for the President to present it to Congress, in the just shape of which it is susceptible. _ I have the honor to be, wuth the greatest respect, your obedient servant, H. KNOX, Secretary of War. The President of the United States. Memorandum from James Seagrove, Hgent of Indian dljfairs, for the Secretary of War United States. ' [extract.] It is the agentâ€™s opinion, that it is a thing impossible for the Indians to comply with the treaty of New York, so far as respects giving up the negroes, and other property taken from the citizens of Georgia, from the conclusion of the late British war, until the time of forming said treaty; and that, therefore^ to prevent a useless and disagreeable altercation, the General Governmerft had better make good the losses sustained, which will not be verry great. The number of negroes taken, under these circumstances, by the Creeks, cannot, he thinks, exceed sixty or seventy. The former owners of negroes would be pleased with this mode of settlement. 3d Congress.]
