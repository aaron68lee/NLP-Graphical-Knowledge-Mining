No. 15. [3d Session. NORTHWESTERN INDIANS. COMMUNICATED TO CONGRESS, DECEMBER 14, 1790. Gentlemen of the Senate , and of the House of Representatives: *, Having informed Congress of. the expedition which had been directed against certain Indians, northwest of the Ohio,51 embrace the earliest opportunity of laying before you the. official communications which have been received upon that subject. , : . . GEO. WASHINGTON. United States, December 147/#, 1790. I . j ’’ War Department, December 14th, 1790. Sir:   1 . 'Lieutenant Denny arrived last evening from fort Washington, on the Ohio, charged with letters from Governor St. Clair and Brigadier General Harmar, copies of which I have the honor herewith to submit, and also extracts from.the orders issued during the late expedition: also a return of the killed and wounded. Lieutenant Denny reports verbally, .that, after he left fort Washington, he saw, in Kentucky, several men of the militia of that district, who had been out with Major Whitly, under Major Hamtramck, of the federal troops, who commanded a separate expedition. . '   j ‘ . The said militiamen informed Lieutenant Denny, that Major Hamtramck had destroyed several of the hostile Indian towns, on the Wabash, and had returned to his garrison, at Post Vincennes, without' having met.any oppo-sition. .

Sir:   " ' - ‘ On the 29th of last month, I had the honor to inform you generally of the success that attended General Harmar. I could not then give you the particulars, as the General’s letters had not reached me; (the officer however who had them in charge got in a few days afterwards) it is not now necessary , because he writes himself. One thing, however, is certain, that the savages have got a most terrible stroke, of which nothing can be a greater proof than that they nave not attempted to harass the army on its return. They arrived at this place on the 3d instant, in good health and spirits. There is not yet any account from Major Hamtramck;. I trust he also lias been successful; but this I think is certain, that no great misfortune can have happened to him: for in that case we should certainly have heard of it. Mr. Denny, the gentleman who takes General Harmar’s despatches, I beg leave to mention to you in a particular manner; and it you will be pleased to do so to the President in his favor, you may be assured lie will not disappoint any expectations that may be formed. He has every quality that I could wish a young man to possess, that meant to make the.army hife profession. There are, however, - some traits in his character as a man, .that are not generally known, that woula endear him. Out of the little pittance he receives, he has maintained two aged parents tor a long time. , ' ' - Brigadier General Harmar to the. Secretary of War. * - * * > ’ Head Quarters, Fort Washington, November 4th, 1790. Sir:   - I have the honor to inform you, that, on the 50th September, I marched with.320 federal troops, and 1,133 militia, total 1,453. After encountering a few difficulties, we gained the Miami village,; It was abandoned before we entered it, which I was very sorry l’or. The villanous traders would have been a principal object of attention. I beg leave to refer you to my orders, which are enclosed. The substance of the work is this, our loss was heavy, but the head quarters of iniquity were broken-up. At a moderate ■ computation, not less than 100 or 120 warriors were slain, and 300 log-houses and wigwams burned. Our loss about 180. The remainder of the Indians will be ill off for sustenance; 20,000 bushels of corn, in the ears, were consumed, burned, and destroyed, by the army, with vegetables in abundance. The loss of Major Wyllys and Lieutenant Frothingham, of the Federal troops, and a number of valuable militia officers, I sincerely lament. The bearer, Lieut Denny, is my adjutant. It will afford me great satisfaction to know that some mark of honor will be shown to him. His longand faithful services merit it. There is a vast deal of business in this Western world. If there is no impropriety in giving me an aid-de-camp, I wish him to be the person. In my next despatches I shall enter into the minutiae of business, and give you a particular description of each day’s march, with all the occurrences and observations. N. B. My adjutant is really and truly an officer. EXTRACTS FROM THE ORDERS. Note. The orders issued previously-to the march of the troops .and militia from fort Washington, and until they   arrived at the Miami village, relate to the arrangement of the troops,'- the order of march, of encampment, and of battle, and the discipline necessary to be observed, all of which are particularly detailed. GENERAL ORDERS. Camp at the Miami Village, about 170 miles from Fort Washington, October \7th, 1790. I . The General is highly pleased with the zeal and alacrity shown by the army, (particularly the corps' which was detached under the command of Colonel Hardin) to come up with the savages, although it was impracticable, as they had evacuated their favorite towns before the light corps could possibly reach them. Leaving behind them such a vast quantity of corn and vegetables, is a certain sign that they decamped in the utmost consternation, and dare not face the enemy. . ; The army is to remain in its present position until further orders; in the mean time. Quartermaster Pratt is to have the corn brought in and deposited in one place, or in as many houses as he can find, and a guard is to be placed over it for its security. He will receive directions how it is to be distributed. The superintendent of the horse department (Mr. Caldwell) is to be responsible that his pack saddles are repaired and put in as good order as possible, ready for.the next movement of the army. The General calls upon the commanding officers of battalions not to suffer their men to straggle from the encampment, otherwise they will certainly stand in danger of being scalped. i The guards are to be extremely vigilant; to which the field officer of the day is to pay the most pointed attention. A detachment, under the command of Lieut. Col. Com. Trotter, consisting of Federal troops, -  - .- - - 30 , ■ Major Fontaine’s light horse. ------ 40 Active riflemen, - - - - . - -   230 Total, morrow early. Lieut. Col. Com. Trotter will receive his orders from the General. 300, are to march to JOS. HARMAR, Brig. General. GENERAL ORDERS. Camp at the Miami Village, October 18th, 1790. The General is much mortified at the unsoldier-like behavior of many of the men in the army, who make it a practice to straggle from the camp in search of plunder. He, in the most positive-terms, forbids this practice in tutu re, and the guards will be answerable to prevent it. No party is to go beyond the line of sentinels without a commissioned officer, who, if of the militia, will apply to Colonel Hardin for his orders. The regular troops, will apply to the General. All the plunder that may be hereafter collected, will be equally distributed amongst the army. The kettles, and every other article already taken, are to be collected by the commanding officers ot battalions, and to be delivered to-morrow morning to Air. Belli, the quartermaster, that a fair distribution may take place. . The rolls are to be called at troop and retreat beating, and every man absent is to be reported. The General expects that these orders will be pointedly attended to—they are to be read to the troops this evening. The army is to march to-morrow morning early for their new encampment at Chillicothe, about two miles from hence. JOS. HARMAR, Brig. General. GENERAL ORDERS. Camp at Chillicothe, one of the Shawanese towns, on the Omee river, October 20th, 1790. The party under command of Captain Strong is ordered to burn and destroy every house and wigwam in this village, together with all the corn, &c. which lie can collect. ■ , A party of 100 men (militia) properly officered, under the command of Colonel Hardin, is to bum and destroy effectually, this afternoon, the Pickaway town, with all the corn, &c. which he can find in it and its vicinity. , The cause of the detachment being worsted yesterday, was entirely owing to the shameful cowardly conduct of the militia, who ran away, and threw down their arms, without firing scarcely a single gun. In returning to fort Washington, if any officer or men shall presume to quit their ranks, or not to march in the form that they are ordered, the General will, most assuredly, order the artillery to fire on them. He hopes the check they received yesterday will make them in future obedient to orders. * JOS. HARMAR, Brig. General. GENERAL ORDERS. Camp at Chillicothe, October 21st. 1790. The army having completely effected the object for which they were ordered, viz. a total destruction of the Maumee towns, as they are generally called, with the vast abundance of corn and vegetables, &c. in them, and their vicinity, are now to commence their march, and to return to fort Washington. The General was in fond hopes that he should be able to break up the Wea towns on his return, but the weak state of the pack horses, and several other circumstances, conspire to render it impracticable at present. Thegeneraleis.tobeatat nine, the assembly at half past nine, and the whole army to take up the line of march precisely at ten this morning. It is not improbable but the savages w ill attempt to harass the army, on its return, particularly the rear and flanks; it is therefore incumbent upon every officer to attend to the duties of his station, and, by no means, to quit their ranks, or create the least contusion; but, on the contrary, to keep silence and good order, otherwise the artil-leiy (agreeably to the orders of yesterday) shall certainly be ordered to fire upon such men as are so lost to every principle of honor, as to run away in. the tune of danger. The cattle and pack horses are to be kept up in the most compact order, and the officer, commanding the rear battalion, is to be responsible with the field officer of the day, that these orders are strictly carried into execution. Such horses as Mr. Caldwell may absolutely stand in need of, are to be taken from the mounted militia, not attached to Major Fontaine’s corps, for public service; if these should be found insufficient, the remainder must come from Major Fontaine’s corps..

AFTER ORDERS. The General is exceedingly pleased with the behavior of the militia' in the action of .this morning. They have laid very many of the enemy dead upon the spot. . Although our loss is great, still it is inconsiderable in comparison of the slaughter made amongst the savages. Every, account agrees that upwards ol one. hundred warriors fell in the battle; it is not more than man for man, and we can afford them two for one. The resolution, and-firm determined conduct of the militia this morning, has effectually retrieved their character, in the opinion of the General. He now knows that they can and will fight. , The loss of Major, Wyllis (with so many of the federal troops) and Major Fontaine, two gallant officers, he sincerely and deeply laments; but it is the fortune of war. . '  . , The General begs Col. Hardin, and Major McMillan, and Major Hall, of Lieutenant Colonel-commandant Trotter’s regiment, together with the officers and privates of the. militia, under their command, to accept his thanks for the bravery displayed by them upon this occasion. „ u \ ’ " ., ’ The army is to march to-morrow morning at eight o’clock, precisely. , .

GENERAL ORDERS. / f Camp, about 24 miles from the ruins of the Maumee Towns, ? ’ " on the return to Fort JJasnington, October 23, ,1790.5 A * ' tl . . _   'The General did not know, in time last evening, of the good conduct’of Brigade Major Ormsby, in rallying a party of the militia and firing upon the savages, whereby he destroyed several of them, otherwise he should then have returned him his thanks. He now begs him to accept them for his cool and gallant behavior at'that time. Although the enemy were so sorely,galled, in the.action of yesterday,’they may still take it into their heads to hover about our encampment. ' The General, therefore, orders that the same vigilance and caution, which has hitherto taken place with the guards, mufet constantly be observed, to which the field officer of the day is to pay the strictest attention.   ' . , . ' 1 -  'The wounded militia arc all to be collected into one place. Dr. Allison and Dr. Carmichael are to attend them, dress them, and give every necessary direction concerning them. The army is to march to-morrow morning, at eight o’clock, precisely. ■ "  , ‘ JOS. HARMAR, Brigadier General.*'GENERAL ORDERS. Head Quarters, Fort Washington, 4th November, 1790. The Kentucky and Pennsylvania militia are to be mustered this afternoon, at 2 o’clock, by Captain Zeigler. The order and regularity which the militia observed on their return to the Ohio river, was highly commendable. Upon the whole, the General is exceedingly pleased with their conduct during the expedition. Notwithstanding our loss yas great, yet, when they reflect that the army, in five weeks, not only effected the capital object of destroying the Miami village, and the Maumee towns, as they are generally called, with the vast quantity of corn and vegetables therein, but, also, killed upwards of one hundred of their warriors, it must afford every man the greatest satisfaction. The militia froui Kentucky are to receive pay until the 10th instant; provisions are to be drawn for them until that time, and to-morrow morning they are to march to their respective homes.   . The General returns his thanks to every officer and private for their good conduct, and_ hereby discharges-them with honor and reputation. The’wounded men are to be left under the care of Doctor Allison and his mates, who will take all possible care of them. >     ■ , _ < ; JOS. HARMAR, Brigadier General. .
