No. 11. [2d Session. THE CREEKS. COMMUNICATED TO THE SENATE, AUGUST 6, 1790. Gentlemen of the Senate: Considering the circumstances which prevented the late commissioners from concluding a peace with the Creek nation of Indians, it appeared to me most prudent, that all subsequent measures for disposing them to a treaty should in the first instance be informal. I informed you on the 4th inst. that the adjustment of the terms of a treaty with their chiefs, now here, was tar advanced; such further progress has since been made, that I think measures may at present be taken for conducting and concluding, that business in form. It therefore becomes necessary that a proper person be appointed and authorized to treat with their chiefs, and to conclude a treaty with them. For this purpose, I nominate to you Henry Knox. GEO. WASHINGTON. United States, August 6th, 1790. * I 1st Congress.]
