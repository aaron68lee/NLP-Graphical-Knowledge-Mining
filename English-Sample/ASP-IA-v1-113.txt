No. 113. [1st Session. LEWIS AND CLARKE’S EXPEDITION. COMMUNICATED TO CONGRESS, FEBRUARY 19, 1806. To the Senate and House, of Representatives of the United States: In pursuance of a measure proposed to Congress, by a message of January 18, 1803, and sanctioned by their appropriation for carrying it.into execution, Captain Meriwether Lewis, of the 1st regiment of infantry, was appointed, with a party of men, to explore the river Missouri, from its mouth to its source, and, crossing the highlands by the shortest portage, to seek the best water communication thence to the Pacific ocean; and Lieutenant Clarke was appointed second in command. They were to enter into conference with the Indian nations on their route, with a view to the establishment of commerce with them. They entered the Missouri, May 11, 1801, and, on the 1st of November, took up their winter quarters near the Mandan towns, 1,609 miles above the mouth of the river, in lat. ■17° 21' 47" north, and long. 99° 34' 45" west from Greenwich. On the 8th of April, 1805, they proceeded up the river, in pursuance of the objects prescribed to them. A letter of the preceding day, April 7, from Captain Lewis, is herewith communicated. During his stay among the Mandans, he had been able to lay down the Missouri, according to courses and distances taken on his passage up it, corrected by frequent observations of longitude and latitude; and, to add to the actual survey of this portion of the river, a general map of the country between the Mississippi and Pacific, Irani the 34th to the 54th degrees of latitude. These additions are from information collected from Indians, with whom he had opportunities of communicating, during his journey and residence with them. Copies of this map are now presented to both Houses of Congress. With these, I communicate also, a statistical view, procured and forwarded by him, of the Indian nations inhabiting the territory of Louisiana, and the countries adjacent to its northern and western borders, of their commerce, and of other interesting circumstances respecting them. In order to render the statement as complete as may be, of the Indians inhabiting the country west of the Missouri, I add Doctor Sibley’s account of those residing in, and adjacent to, the territory of Orleans. I communicate, also, from the same person, an account of the Red river, according to the best information he had been able 1o collect. Having been disappointed, after considerable preparation, in the purpose of sending an exploring party up that river, in the summer of 1804, it was thought best to employ the autumn of that year in procuring a knowledge of an interesting branch of the river called the Washita. This was undertaken under the direction of Mr. Dunbar, of Natchez, a citizen of distinguished science, who had aided, and continues to aid us, with his disinterested and valuable sen ices, in the prosecution of these enterprises. He ascended the river to the remarkable hot springs, near it, in lat. 34° 31' 4.1G" long. 92° 50' 45" west from Greenwich, baking its courses and distances, and correcting them by frequent celestial observations. Extracts from his observations, and copies of his map of the river, from its mouth to the hot springs, make part of the present communications. The examination of the Red river itself, is but now commencing. TH: JEFFERSON. February 19, 1806. Extract of a letter from Meriwether Lewis to the President of the United States, dated Fort Mandan, Jlpril 7, 1805. Dear Sir: Herewith enclosed you will receive an invoice of certain articles, which I have forwarded to you from this place. Among the articles, you will observe, by reference to the invoice, sixty-seven specimens of earths, salts, and minerals, and sixty specimens of plants. These are accompanied by their respective labels, expressing the days on which obtained, places where found, and also, their virtues and properties, when known. By means of the labels, reference may be made to the chart forwarded to the Secretary of War, on which the encampment of each day has been carefully marked; thus, the places at which these specimens have been obtained, may be easily pointed out, or found, should any of them prove valuable to the community, on further investigation. You will also receive, herewith enclosed, a part of Captain Clarke's private journal: the. other part you will find enclosed in a separate tin box. This journal will serve to give you the daily details of our progress.and transactions. I shall despatch a canoe with three, perhaps four, persons, from the extreme navigable point of the Missouri, or the portage between this river and the Columbia river, as either may first happen. By the return of this canoe, I shall send you my journal, and some one or two of the best kept by my men. I have sent a journal, kept by one of the sergeants, to Captain Stoddard, my agent at St. Louis, in order, as much as possible, to multiply the chances of saving something. We have encouraged our men to keep journals, and seven of them do so: to whom, in this respect, we give every assistance in our power. I have transmitted to the Secretary of War, every information relative to the geography ot the country which we possess, together with a view of the Indian nations, containing information relative to them, on those points with which I conceived it important that the Government should be informed. . % reference to the muster-rolls forwarded to the War Department, you will see the state of the party. In addition to which, we have two interpreters, one negro man, servant to Captain Clarke, one Indian woman, wife to one of Ihe interpreters, and a Mandan man, whom we take with a view to restore peace between the Snake Indians and those in this neighborhood, amounting, in total, with ourselves, to thirty-three persons. By means of the inter-preters and Indians, we shall be enabled to converse with all the Indians that we shall probably meet with on the Missouri. 1 have forwarded to the Secretary of War my public accounts, rendered up to the present day. They have been much longer delayed than I had any idea that they would have been, when we departed from the Illinois; but this delay, under the circumstances which I was compelled to act, has been unavoidable. The provision pirogue, and her crew, could not have been dismissed in time to have returned to St. Louis last fall, without evidently, in my opinion, hazarding the fate of the enterprise in.which I am engaged, and I therefore did not hesitate to prefer the censure that I may have incurred by the detention of these papers, to that of risking, in any degree, the success of the expedition. To me, the detention of these papers have formed a serious source of disquiet and anxiety; and the recollection of your particular charge to me, on this subject, has made it still more poignant. I am fully aware of the inconvenience which must have arisen to the War Department, from the want of these vouchers, previous to the last session of Congress, but, how to avert it, was out of my power to devise. From this place, we shall send the barge and crew early to-morrow morning, with orders to proceed, as expeditiously as possible, to St. Louis; by her we send our despatches, which, I trust, will get safe to hand. Her crew consists of ten able bodied men, well armed, and provided with a sufficient stock of provision to last them to St. Louis. I have little doubt but they will be fired on by the Siouxs; but they have pledged themselves to us that they will not yield while there is a man of them living. Our baggage is all embarked on board six small canoes and two pirogues; we shall set out at the same moment that we despatch the barge. One, or perhaps both, of these pirogues, we shall leave at the falls of the Missouri: from whence we intend continuing our voyage in the canoes and a pirogue, of skins, the frame of which was prepared at Harper’s ferry. This pirogue is now in a situation which will enable ns to prepare it in the course of a few hours. As our vessels are now small, and the current of the river much more moderate, we calculate on travelling at the rate of twenty or twenty-five miles per day, as far as the falls of Missouri. Beyond this point, or the first range of Rocky mountain, situated about one hundred miles further, any calculation with respect to our daily progress, can be but little more than bare conjecture. The circumstance of the Snake Indians possessing large quantities of horses, is much in our favor, as, by means of horses, the transportation of our baggage will be rendered easy and expeditious over land, from the Missouri to the Cumberland river. Should this river not prove navigable where we first meet with it, our present intention is to continue our march by land down the river until it becomes so, or to the Pacific ocean. The map which has been forwarded to the Secretary of War, will give you the idea we entertain of the connexion of these rivers, which has been formed from the corresponding testimony of a number of Indians, who have visited that country, and who have been separately and carefully examined on that subject, and we therefore think it entitled to some degree of confidence. Since our arrival at this place, we have subsisted principally on meat, with which our guns have supplied us amply, and have thus been enabled to reserve the parched meal, portable soup, and a considerable portion ol pork and flour, which we hail intended for the more difficult parts of our voyage, if Indian information can be credited, the vast quantity of game with which the country abounds, through which we are to pass, leaves us but little to apprehend from the want of food. . We do not calculate on completing our voyage within the present year, but expect to reach the Pacific ocean, and return as far as the head of tne Missouri, or perhaps to this place, before winter. You may, therefore, expect to meet me at Monticello, in September, 1806. On our return, we shall probably pass down the Yellow Stone river, which, from Indian information, waters one of the fairest portions of this continent. I can foresee no natural or probable obstruction to our progress, and entertain, therefore, the most sanguine hopes of complete success. As to myself, individually, I never enjoyed a more perfect state of good health than I have since we commenced our voyage. My inestimable friend and companion, Captain Clarke, has also enjoyed good health generally. At this moment, every individual of the party are in good health, and excellent spirits, zealously attached to the enterprise, and anxious to proceed. Not a whisper of discontent or murmur is to be heard amongst them, but, all in unison, act with the most perfect harmony. With such men, I have every thing to hope, and but little to fear. Be so good as to present my most affectionate regard to all my friends, and be assured of the sincere and unalterable attachment of Your most obedient servant, MERIW ETHER LEWIS, Captain 1st U.

THE INDIAN TRADE. The sums stated under and opposite u L,” are the amounts of merchandise annually furnished the several nations of Indians, including all incidental expenses of transportation, &c. incurred by the merchants, w hich generally averages about one-third of the whole amount. The merchandise is estimated at an advance of 105 per cent, on the sterling cost. It appears to me, that the amount of merchandise which the Indians have been in the habit of receiving. annually, is the best standard by w hich to regulate the quantities necessary for them. In the first instance, they will always consume as much merchandise as they can pay lor: and those to whom a regular trade has been carried on, have generally received that quantity. The amount of their returns, stated under and opposite “ M."’ are estimated by the peltry standard of St. Loin’s, which is '10 cents per pound, for deer skins, i. e. all furs and peltries are first reduced, by their comparative value, to lbs. of merchantable deer skins, which are then estimated at 40 cents per lb. !j These establishments are not mentioned as being thought important, in a government point of view.

Claim the country within the following limits, viz: Commencing at the mouth of a south branch of the Osage river, called Neangua, and with the same to its source; thence southwardly, to intersect the Arkansas, about one hundred miles below the three forks of that river; thence up the principal branch of the same, to the confluence of a large northwardly branch of the same, lying a considerable distance west of the Great Saline, and with that stream, nearly to its source; thence northwardly, towards the Kansas river, embracing the waters of the upper portion of the Osage river: and thence obliquely approaching the same, to the beginning. The climate is delightful, and the soil fertile, in the extreme. The face of the country is generally level, and wel I watered. The eastern part of the country is covered with a variety of timber, of an excellent quality; the west- F. ern and middle country, high prairies. It embraces G. within its limits lour salines, which are, in point of II. magnitude and excellence, unequalled by any known I. in North America. There are also many others of less note. The principal part of the Great Osage J. have always resided at their villages, on the Osage K. river, since they have been known to the inhabitants of Louisiana. About three years since, nearly one- L. half of this nation, headed by their chief, Big Track, M. emigrated to the three forks of the Arkansas, near N. which, and on its north side, they established a village, where they now reside. The Little Osage for- 0. merly resided on the southwest side of the Missouri, near the mouth of Grand river; but, being reduced by continual warfare with their neighbors, were compelled to seek the protection of the Great Osage, near whom they now reside. There is no doubt but their P. trade will increase. They could furnish a much larger quantity of beaver than they do. I think two villages, on the Osage river, might be prevailed on to Q. remove to the Arkansas, and the Kansas higher up the Missouri, and thus leave a sufficient scope of R. country for the Shawanese, Delawares, Miatnies, and S.

I do not believe that they would object to the introduction of any well-disposed Indians. They treat the traders with respect and hospitality generally. In their occupations of hunting and cultivation, they are the same with the Kansas and Osage. They hunt on the Saline and Nimmehaw rivers, and west of them in the plains. The country in which they hunt lies well; it is extremely fertile and well watered: that part of it which borders on the Nimmehaw and Missouri, possesses a good portion of timber. Population rather increasing. They have always resided near the place their village is situated, and are the descendants of the Missouries. N. The same as the Great Osages. O.

They hunt on the upper part of Kansas and Arkansas rivers. Their trade may be expected to increase with proper management. At present, they are a dissolute, lawless banditti; frequently plunder their traders, and commit depredations on persons ascending and descending the river Missouri. Population rather increasing. These people, as well as the Great and Little Osages, are stationary at their villages, from about the 15th of March to the 15th of May; and again from the 15th of August to the 15th of October; the balance of the year is appropriated to hunting.

Their ancient, and principal village, was situated in an extensive and fertile plain, on the north bank of the Missouri, just below the entrance of the Grand river. Repeated attacks of the small pox, together with their war with the Saukees and Renars. have reduced them to their present state of dependence on the Ottoes, with whom they reside, as well in their village as on their hunting excursions. The Ottoes view them as their inferiors, and sometimes treat them amiss. These people are the real proprietors of an extensive and fertile country, lying on the Missouri,'above their ancient village, for a considerable distance, and as low as the mouth of the Osage river, and thence to the Mississippi.

They hunt on the south side of the river Platte, higher up, and on the head of the Kansas. A great proportion of this country is open plains, interspersed, however, with groves ol timber, which are most generally found in the vicinity of water courses; it is generally fertile and well watered; lies level, and free of stone. They have resided in the country which they now inhabit, since they were known to the whites. Their trade is a valuable one. from the large proportion of beaver and otter which they furnish.; and it may be expected yet to increase, as those animals are still abundant in their country. The periods of their residence at their village, and hunting, are similar to the Kansas ami Osages. Their population is increasing. They are friendly and hospitable to all white persons, pay great respect and deference to their traders, with whom they are punctual in the payment of their debts. They are, in all respects, a friendly, well-disposed people. They cultivate corn, beans, tnellons, &c. A. Panias Republican. II. Ar-ra-pa-itoo. C. Republic. I). Pania. E.

They afterwards subdivided, and lived in different parts of the country, on the waters of Kansas river: hut being harassed by their turbulent neighbors, the Kansas, they rejoined the Panias proper last spring. What has been said with respect to the Panias proper, is applicable to these people, except that they hunt principally on the Republican river, which is better stocked with timber than that hunted by the Panias.

These are also a branch of the Panias proper, who separated themselves from that nation many years since, and established themselves on a north branch of the river Platte, to which their name was also given; these people have likewise no idea of an exclusive right to any portion of country; they hunt ou tlie Wolf river, above their village, and oil the river Platte, above the mouth of that river. This country is very similar to that of the Panias proper; though there is an extensive body of fertile well-timbered land, between tbe Y\ oil river below their village and the riverCorne du Cerfor Elkborn river. They cultivate corn, beans, &c. The particulars related of the other Panias, are also applicable to them. They are seldom visited by any trader, and therefore usually bring their furs and peltry to the village of the Panias proper, where they traffic with the whites. A. Malias. B. O-ma-ha. (J. La Mar.

Tliey have no idea of exclusive possession of soil. About ten years since, they boasted 700 warriors: they have lived in a village on the west bank of the Missouri, 236 miles above the mouth of the river Platte, where they cultivated corn, beans and melons; they were warlike, and the terror of their neighbors. In the summer and autumn of tS02. they were visited by tin; small pox, which reduced their number to something less than 300; they burnt their village, and have become a wandering nation, deserted by the traders; and the consequent deficiency of .inns and ammunition has invited frequent aggressions from their neighbors, which has tended to reduce them still fur-  ther. They rove principally on the waiters of the river Quieurre or Rapid river. The country is generally level, high, open plains; it is fertile, and tolerably well watered; they might easily be induced to become stationary; they are well-disposed towards the whites, and are good hunters: their country abounds in beaver and otter, and their trade wilt increase and become valuable, provided tliey become stationary and are at peace.

The remains of ten large tribes of Panias, who have been reduced, by the small-pox and the Sioux, to their present number; they live in fortified villages, and hunt immediately in their neighborhood; the coun- 1 try around them, in every direction, for several hundred miles, is bare of timber, except on the watercourses, and steep declivities of hills, where it is sheltered from the ravages of fire; the land is tolerably well watered, and lies well for cultivation. The remains of the villages of these people are to be seen on many parts of the Missouri, from the mouth of Tetone river, to the Mandans; they claim no land, except that on which their villages stand, and the fields which they cultivate. The Tetons claim the country around them, though they are the oldest inhabitants ; they may properly be considered the farmers or tenants at will of that lawless, savage, and rapacious race, theSioux Teton, who rob them of their horses, plunder their gardens and fields, and sometimes murder them without opposition. If these people were freed from the oppression of the Tetons, their trade would increase rapidly, and might be extended to a considerable amount; they maintain a partial trade with their oppressors the Tetons, to whom they barter horses, mules, corn, beans, and a species of tobacco, which they cultivate; and receive in return, guns, ammunition, kettles, axes, and other articles, which the Tetons obtain from the Yanktons of the north, -and Sissatones, who trade with Mr. Cameron, on the river St. Peters. Their horses and mules.the Ricaras obtain from their western neighbors, who visit 'them frequently, lor the purpose of trafficking. A. Mandans. 15.

These are the most friendly, well disposed Indians, inhabiting the Missouri; they are brave, humane, and hospitable.. About 25 years since, they lived in six villages, about 40 miles below their present villages, on both sides of the Missouri. Repeated visitations of the..small-pox, aided by frequent attacks of the Sioux, has reduced them to their present number. They claim no particular tract of country; they live in fortified villages, hunt immediately in their neighborhood, and cultivate.com, beans, squashes, and tobacco, which form articles of traffic with their neighbors, the Assinniboins; they also barter horses with thej Assinniboins, for arms, ammunition, axes, kettles, and. other articles of European manufacture, which these last obtain from the British establishments on the Assinniboin river. The articles which they thus obtain from the Assinniboins, and the British traders-who visit them, they again exchange for horses and leather tents, with the Crow Indians, Chyennes, Wretepahatoes, Kiawans, Kanenavish, Staitan, and Cataka, who visit them occasionally, lor the purpose of traffic; their trade may be rriucn increased; their country is similar to that of the Ricaras; population increasing.

I believe that these people, as well as the Mandans and Ahwahha-ways, might be prevailed on to remove to the mouth of Yellow Stone river, provided an establishment is made at that place. They have, as yet, furnished scarcely any beaver, although the country they hunt abounds with them; the lodges of these animals are * to be seen within a mile of the villages: these people have also suffered considerably by the small-pox, but have successfully resisted the attacks of the Sioux. The Northwest company intend to form an establishment, in the course of the next summer and autumn, on the Missouri, near these people, which, if effected, will most probably prevent their removal to any point which our Government may hereafter wish them to reside at.

These nations are so perfectly consolidated, that they may in fact be considered as one nation only; they speak the same language; they formerly resided on the east side of the Mississippi, and still claim the land on that side of the river, from the mouth of the Ouisconsin to the Illinois river, and eastward towards lake Michigan, but to what particular boundary I am not informed; they also claim, by conquest, the whole of the country belonging to the ancient Missouries, which forms one of the most valuable portions of Louisiana: but what proportion of this territory they are willing to assign to the Ayouwais, who also claim a part of it, I do not know. As they are at war with the Sioux, who live. N. and N. W. of them, except the Yankton Ahnah, their boundaries in that quarter are also undefined; their trade would become much more valuable if peace was established between them and the nations west of the Missouri, with whom they are at war; their population ha> remained nearly the same for many years: they raise an abundance of corn, beans, and melons: they sometimes hunt in the country west of them towards the Missouri, hut their principal hunting is on both sides of the Mississippi, from the mouth of the Ouisconsin to the month ot the Illinois river. These people are extremely friendly to the whites, and seldom injure their traders: but they are the'most implacable enemies to the Indian nations with whom they are at w ar; to them is justly attributable the almost entire destruction of I he Missouries, the Illinois, Cahokias, Kaskaskias, and Peorias.

S. JVuhpatone. Claim the. country in which they rove on the N. W. side of the river St. Peters, from their village to the mouth of the Chippewa river, and thence northeastwardly towards the head of the Mississippi, including the Crbw-wing river. Their lands are fertile, and generally well timbered. They are only stationary while the traders are with them, which is from the beginning of October, to the last of March. Their trade is supposed to be at its greatest extent; they treat their traders with respect, and seldom attempt to rob them. This, as well as the other Sioux bands, act, in all respects, as independently of each-other as if they were a distinct nation. * ' - S. Mindawarcarton. ’Tis the only band of Sioux that cultivate corn, beans, &c. and these even cannot properly be termed a stationary people. They live in tents of dressed leather, which they transport by means of horses and dogs, and ramble from place to place during the greater part of the year. They are friendly to their own traders, but the inverate enemies to such as supply their enemies, the Chippewas, * with merchandise. They also claim the country in which they hunt, commencing at the entrance of the river St. Peters, and extending upwards, on both sides of the. Mississippi river, to the mouth of the Crow-wing river. The land is fertile, and well watered; lies level, and sufficiently timbered. Their trade cannot be expected to increase much. S. IVulipacoota. They.rove in the country southwest of the river St. Peters, from a place called the .Hanlwoocl, to the mouth of the Yellow Medicine river: never stationary but when their traders are with them, and this, does not happen at any regular and fixed point; at present they treat traders tolerably well; their trade cannot be expected to increase much. A great proportion of their country is open plains, lies level, and is tolerably fertile; they maintain a partial traffic with the Yanktons and Tetons, to the west of them; to these they barter the articles which they obtain from the traders on the river St. Peters, and receive, in return, horses, some robes, and leather lodges. S. Sissatone —They claim the country in which they rove, embracing the upper portions of the red river of lake. Winnipie, and St. Peters. It is a level country, intersected with many small lakes; the land is fertile and free of stone; the majority ot it open plains. This country abounds more in the valuable fur animals, the beaver, otter, and martin, than any portion of Louisiana yet known. This circumstance furnishes the Sissatones with means of purchasing more merchandise, in proportion to their number, than any ■ nation in this quarter. A great proportion of this * merchandise is reserved by them for their trade with the Tetons, whom they annually meet, at some point previously agreed on, upon the waters of James river, in the month of May. This Indian fair is frequently attended by the Yanktons of the north and Ahnah. The Sissatones and Yanktons of the north, here sup   ply the others with considerable quantities of arms, ammunition,axes, knives, kettles, cloth,and a variety of other articles; and receive, in return, principally, horses, which the others have stolen, or purchased from the nations on the Missouri and west of it. They are devoted to the interest of their traders. S. Yanktons of the North.—This band, although they purchase a much smaller quantity of merchandise than the Sissatones, still appropriate a considerable portion of what they do obtain, in a similar manner with that mentioned of the Sissatones. This trade, as small as it may appear, has been sufficient to render the Tetons independent of the trade of the Missouri, in a great measure, and has furnished them with the means, not only of distressing and plundering the traders of the Missouri, but also, of plundering and massacreing the defenceless savages of the Missouri, from the mouth of the river Platte to the Minetares, and west of the Rocky mountains. The country that these people inhabit, is almost one entire plain, uncovered with timber; it is extremely level, the soil fertile, and generally well watered. S. Yanktons Ahnah.-—These are the best disposed Siouxs who rove on the banks of the Missouri, and these , even will not sutler any trader to ascend the river, if they can possibly avoid it. They have heretofore, invariably arrested the progress ot all those they have met with, and generally compelled them to trade at the prices, nearly, which they themselves think proper to fix on their merchandise. They seldom commit any further acts of violence on the whites; they sometimes visit the river Demoin, where a partial trade has been carried on with them for a few years . past, by a Mr. Crawford; their trade, if well regulated, might be rendered extremely ratable. Then-country is a very fertile one; it consists of a mixture of wood lands and prairies; the land bordering on the Missouri, is principally plains, with but little timber. Tetons Hois rule. Tetons-Okandundas. 7etons-Min-nakincuzzo. Tetons Sahone.—These are the vilest miscreants of the savage race, and must, ever remain the pirates of the Missouri, until such measures are pursued by our Government, as will make them feel a dependence on its will for their supply of merchandise. Unless these people are reduced to order, by coercive measures, I am ready to pronouce, that the citizens of the United States can never enjoy, but partially, the advantages which the Missouri presents. Relying on a regular supply of merchandise through the channel of the river St. Peters, they view with contempt the merchants of the Missouri, whom they never fail to plunder when in their power; persuasion or advice, with them, is viewed as supplication, and only tends to inspire them with contempt ,t for those who offer either. The tameness with which the traders of the Missouri have heretofore submitted to their rapacity, lias tended not a little to inspire them with contempt for the white persons who visit them through that channel. A prevalent idea among them, and one which they make the rule of their conduct, is, that the more illy they treat the traders,* the greater quantity of merchandise they will bring them; and that they will thus obtain the articles they wish, on belter terms. They have endeavored to inspire the Ricaras with similar sentiments, but happily without any considerable effect. The country in which these tuur bandsiovc, is one continual plain, with scarcely a tree to be seen, except on the water courses, or the steep declivities of hills, which last are but rate; the land is fertile, and lies extremely well for cultivation; many parts of it are-but badly watered. It is from this country that the Missouri derives most of its coloring matter; the earth is strongly impregnated with glauber salts, alum, copperas, and sulphur, and when saturated with water, immense bodies of the hills precipitate themselves into the M issouri, and mingle with its waters. The waters of this river have a purgative effect on those unaccustomed to use it. 1 doubt whether these people can ever be induced to become stationary; their trade might be made valuable if they were reduced to order. They claim jointly, with the other bands of Sioux, all the country lying within the following limits, viz: beginning at the confluence of the river Demoine and Mississippi; thence, up the west side of the Mississippi, to the mouth of the St. Peters river; thence, on both sides of the Mississippi, to the mouth of Crow-wing river, and upwards with that stream, including the waters of the upper part of the same; thence, to include the waters of the upper portion of Red river of lake Winnipie, and down the same nearly to Pembenar river;’thence, a southwesterly course to intersect the Missouri at or near the Man-dans, and with that stream downward to the entrance of the Wanecunne creek; thence, passing the Missouri, it goes to include the lower portion of the river ■ Chycone, all the waters of White river, and river Teton, includes the lower portion of the river Gui-curre, and returns to the Missouri, and, with that stream downward, to the mouth of Waddepon river; and thence, eastwardly to intersect the Mississippi at the beginning.

The country in which they rove is almost entirely uncovered with timber; lies extremely level, and is but badly watered in many parts; the land, however, is tolerably fertile, and unincumbered with stone. They might be induced to trade at the river Yellow Stone, but I do not think that their trade promises much. Their numbers continue about the same. These bands, like the Sioux, act entirely independent of each other, though they claim a national affinity, and never make war on each other. The country inhabited by the Mahto-panato possesses rather more timber than the other parts ol the country. They do not cultivate. 91 * CHIPPEWAB 15. C. I). E. F. G. II. I.

This country is thickly covered with limber generally; lies level, and generally fertile, though a considerable proportion of it is intersected and broken up by small lakes, morasses, and swamps, particularly about the heads of the Mississippi, and river St. Louis. They do not cultivate, but live principally on the wild rice, which they procure in great abundance on the borders of Leach lake, and the banks of the Mississippi.

Claim the country about Red lake, and Red lake river, as far as the Red river of Lake Win-nipic. beyond which last river they contend with the Sioux for territory. This is a low level country, and generally thickly covered with timber^ inlerrnpted with many swamps and morasses. This, as well as the other bands of Chippewas. are esteemed the best hunters in the N. W. country; but, from the long residence of this band in the country they now inhabit, game is becoming scarce; therefore, their trade is supposed to be at its greatest extent. The Chippewas are a well disposed people, but excessively fond of spirituous liquor. Of river Pembena. These people formerly resided on the east side of the Mississippi, at Sand lake, but were induced by the N. W. company, to remove about two years since, to the river Pembena. They do not claim the lands on which they hunt. The country is level, and the soil good. The west side of the river is principally prairies, or open plains; on the east side there is a greater proportion of timber. Their trade at present is a very valuable ome, and will probably increase for some years. They do not cultivate, but live by hunting; they are well disposed towards the whites.

These prisoners have been seen by the Frenchmen residing in this neighborhood. The Minatares state that; this nation reside in one village, on the w est side of a large and rapid river, which runs from south to N. along the foot of the Rocky Mountains on their west side, and that this river passes at a small distance from the three forks of the Missouri; that the country between the mountains and the river is broken, but on the opposite side of the river it is an extensive, open plain, with a number of barren, sandy hills, irregularly distributed over its surface, as far as the eye can reach. They are a timid, inoffensive, and defenceless people. They are said to possess an abundance of horses. to H <1 B. C. D. E. F. G. H. I.

S.—Aliatans.—Snake Indiana. These are a very numerous ami well disposed people, inhabiting a woody and mountainous country. They are divided into three large tribes, who wander at a considerable distance from each other, and are called by themselves So-soma, So-so-ba-b.ir, and I-a-kar; these are again sub-divided intosinaller, though independent bands, the names of which I have not yet learnt. They raise a number of horses and mules, which they trade with the Crow Indians, or are stolen by the Indians on the east of them. Thev maintain a partial trade with the Spaniards, from whom they obtain many articles of clothing and ironmongery, but no warlike implements. Of the IFest. These people also inhabit a mountainous country, and sometimes venture in the plains east of the Rocky mountains, about the head of the Arkansas liver; they have more intercourse with the Spaniards of New Mexico than the Snake Indians; they are said to be very numerous and warlike, but are badly armed. The Spaniards fear these people, and therefore take the precaution not to furnish them with any warlike implements. In their present unarmed state, they frequently commit hostilities on the Spaniards. They raise a great many horses. La Playes. These principally inhabit the rich plains from the head of the Arkansas, embracing the heads of Red river, and extending with the mountains and high lands, eastwardly, as far as it is known, towards the Gulf of Mexico. They possess no fire arms, but are warlike and brave. They are, as well as the other Aliatans, a wandering people. Their country abounds in wild horses, besides great numbers which they raise themselves. These people and the West Aliatans might be induced to trade with ns on the upper part of the Arkansas river. I do not believe that any of the Aliatans claim a country within any particular limits. A. Pania Pique. B. C. La Paunee Pique. D. Pania Proper. E. F. G. H. I. J. K. L. M. N. O. P. Q. R. S. These people have no intercourse with the inhabitants of the Illinois; the information, therefore, which I have been enabled to obtain with respect to them is very imperfect.

They are said to be a well disposed people, and inhabit a very fertile country: certain it is, that they enjoy a delightful climate. A. Paducas. 15. C. La Padde. D. * E. F. G. II. I. J. K. L. M. N. 0. P. Q. R. S. This once powerful nation has entirely disappeared, (apparently.) Every inquiry lliave made alter them has proved ineffectual. In the year 1724 they resided in several villages on the heads of the Kansas river, and could, at that time, bring upwards of two thousand men into the field, (see Mons. Dupratz’History of Louisiana, page 71, and the map attached to that work.) 'l'lie information that I have received is, that, being oppressed by the nations residing on the Missouri, they removed to the upper part of the river Platte, where they afterwards had but little intercourse with the whites. They seem to have given name to the northern branch of that river, which is still called the Paducas fork. The most probable conjecture is. that, being still further reduced, they have divided into small wandering bands, which assumed the names of the sub-divisions of the Paducas nation, anti are known to us at present under the appellation of Wetepahaloes, Kiawas, Kanenavisn. Katteka, Dotame, Nc. who still inhabit the country to which the Paducas are said to have removed. The majority of my information led me to believe that these people spoke different languages, but other and subsequent inlormation has induced me to doubt the fact. Historical Sketches of the several Indian tribes in Louisiana, south of the Arkansas river, and between the .Mississippi and river Grande. C.vDDoquEs.—Live about thirty-five miles west of the main branch of Red l iver, on a bavou or creek, called, by them, Sodo, which is navigable for pirogues only, within about six miles of their village, ami that only in the rainy season. Thev are distant from Natchitoches about 120 miles, the nearest route by land, and in nearly a northwest direction. They have lived where they now do, only five years. The first year they moved there, the small pox got amongst them, and destroyed nearly one half of them; it was in the winter season, and they practised plunging into the creek, on the first appearance of the irruption, and died in a few hours. Two years ago they had the measles, of which several more of them died. They formerly lived on the south bank of the river, by the course of the river 375 miles Higher up, at a beautiful prairie, which has a clear lake of good water in the middle of it, surrounded by a pleasant and fertile country, which had been the residence of their ancestors from time immemorial. They have a traditionary tale, which not only the Caddoes, but half a dozen other smaller nations believe in. who claim the honor of being descendants of the same family; they say, when all the world was drowning by a flood, that inundated the whole country, the Great Spirit placed on an eminence, near this lake, one family of Caddoques, who alone were saved; from that family all the Indians originated. 'I'he French, for many years before Louisiana was transferred to Spain, had, at this place, a fort and some soldiers; several French families were likewise settled in the vicinity, where they had erected a good flour mill, with burr stones brought from France. These French families continued there till about twenty-live years ago, when they moved down and settled at Compti, on the Red river, about twenty miles above Natchitoches, where they now live; and the Indians left it about fourteen years ago, on account of a dreadful sickness that visited them. They settled on the river nearly opposite where they now live, on a low place, but were drove from there on account of its overflowing, occasioned by a jam of timber choking (lie river at a point below them. The whole number of what they call warriors of the ancient Caddo nation, is now reduced to about one hundred, who are looked upon somewhat like Knights of Malta, or some distinguished military order. They are brave, despise danger or death, and boast that they have never shed white men’s blood. Besides these, there are of old men, and strangers who live amongst them, nearly (lie same number; but there are forty or fifty more women than men. This nation has great influence over the Yattassees, Nandakoes, Nabadaclies, lilies or Tackies, Nacogdoches. Keychies, Adaize, and Natchitoches, who all speak the Caddo language, look up to them as their fathers, visit and intermarry among (hem, and join them in all their wars. The Caddoques complain of the Choctaws encroaching upon their country; call them lazy, thievish, &c. There has been a misunderstanding between them for several years, and small hunting parties kill one another when they meet. The Caddoe3 raise corn, beans, pumpkins, &c. but the land on which they now live is prairie, of a white clay soil, very fiat; their crops are subject to injury, either by too wet or too dry a season. They have horses, but few of any other domestic animal, except dogs: most of them bar e guns, and some of (hem have rifles. They, and all other Ind ians that we have any knowledge of, are al war with the Osages. The country, generally, round the Caddoes, is hilly, not very rich; growth, a mixture of oak, hickory, and pine, interspersed with prairies, which are very rich, generally, and (it for cultivation. There are creeks and springs of good water frequent. Yattassees.—hive on Bayou river, (or Stony creek) which falls into Red river, western division, about fifty miles above Natchitoches. Their village is in a large prairie, about half way between the Caddoques anil Natchitoches, surrounded by a settlement of French families. The Spanish Government, at present, exercise jurisdiction over this settlement,’where they keep a guard of a non-commissioned officer and eight soldiers. A few months ago, the Caddo chief, with a few of his young men, were coming to this place to trade, and came that way, which is the usual road; the Spanish officer of the guard threatened to stop them from trading with the Americans, and told the chief, if he returned that way with goods, he should Like them from him. The chief and his party were very angry, and threatened to kill the whole guard; and told them, that that road had been always theirs, and that, if the Spaniards attempted to prevent their using it, as their ancestors had always done, he would soon make it a bloody road. He came here, purchased the goods he wanted, and might have returned another way, and avoided the Spanish guard, and was advised to do so, but lie said he would pass by them, and let them attempt to stop him if they dare. The guard said nothing to him as he returned. This settlement, till some few years ago, used to belong to tne district of Natchitoches, and the rights to their lands given by the Government of Louisiana, before it was ceded to Spain. Its now being under the Government of Texas, was only by an agreement between the commandant of Natchitoches and the commandant of Nacogdoches. The French formerly held a station and factory there, and another on ihe Sabine river, nearly a hundred miles northwest from the Bayou Pierre settlement. The Yattassees now say the French used to be their people, and now the Americans; but of the ancient Yattassees there are but eight men remaining, and twenty-live women, besides children; but a number of men of other nations have intermarried with them, and live together. I paid a visit at their village the last summer; there were about forty men of them altogether. Their original language differs from any other; but now, all speak Caddo. They live on rich land, raise plenty of corn, beans, pumpkins, tobacco, &c. have horses, cattle, hogs, and poultry. Na.n’dakoes.—Live on the Sabine river, sixty or seventy miles to the westward of the Yattassees, near where the French formerly had a station and factory. Their language is Caddo; about forty men of them only remaining. A few years ago they suffered very much by the small pox. They consider themselves the same as Caddoes, with whom they intermarry, and are occasionally visiting one another in the greatest harmony; have the same manners, customs, and attachments. Adaize.—Live about forty miles from Natchitoches, below the Yattassees, on a lake called Lac Macdon, which communicates with that division of Red river that passes by Bayou Pierre; they live at, or near, where their ancestors have lived from time immemorial. They being the nearest nation to the old Spanish fort, or mission of Adaize, that place was named alter them, being about twenty miles from them, to the south. There are now but twenty men of them remaining, but more women. Their language differs from all other, and is so difficult to speak, or understand, that no other nation can speak ten words of it; but they all speak Caddo, and most of them French, to whom they were always attached, and joined them against the Natchez Indians. After the massacre of Natchez, in 1798, while the Spaniards occupied the post of Adaize, their priests took much pains to proselyte these Indians to the Roman Catholic religion, but, 1 am informed, were totally unsuccessful. Alicice, (commonly pronounced Kyeish.)—Live near Nacogdoches, but are almost extinct as a nation, not being more than twenty-five souls of them remaining; four years ago the small pox destroyed the most of them. They were some years ago a considerable nation, and lived on a bayou which bears their name, which the road from Natchitoches to Nacogdoches crosses about twelve miles west of Sabine river, on which a few French and American families are settled. Their native language is spoken by no other nation; but they speak and understand Caddo, with whom they are in amity, often visiting one another. Kf.yes, or Keyciiies.—Live on the’east, bank of Trinity river, a small distance above where the road from Natchitoches to St. Antoine crosses it. There are of them sixty men; have their peculiar native language, but mostly now speak Caddo, intermarry with them, and live together in much harmony, formerly having lived near them on the head waters of the Sabine. They plant corn, and some other vegetables. Inif.s, or Tachies, (called indifferently by both names.) From the latter name, the name of the province of Taclms or Texas is derived. The lilies live about ttventy-five miles west of Natchitoches, on a small river, a branch of the Sabine, called the Natchez; they are like all their neighbors, diminishing; but have now eighty men. Their ancestors, for a long time, lived where they now do. Their language the same as that of the Caddoes, with whom they are in great amity. These Indians have a good character, live on excellent land, and raise corn to sell. Nabedaches.—Live on the west side of the same river, about fifteen miles above them; have about the same number of men; speak the same language; live on the best of land; raise corn in plenty; have the same manners, customs, and attachments. Bedies.—Are on the Trinity river, about sixty miles to the southward of Nacogdoches; have one hundred men; are good hunters for deer, which are very large and plenty about them; plant, and make good crops of corn; language differs from all other, but speak Caddo; are a peaceable cpiiet people, and have an excellent character for their honesty and punctuality. Accokesaws.—Their ancient town, and principal place of residence, is on the west side of the Colerado, or Rio Rouge, about two hundred miles southwest of Nacogdoches, but often change their place of residence for a season; being near the bay, make great use of fish, oysters, &c. kill a great many deer, which are the largest and fattest in the province; and their country is universally said to be inferior to no part of the province, in soil, growth of timber, goodness of water, and beauty of surface; have a language peculiar to themselves, but have a mode of communication by dumb signs, which they all understand. Number, about eighty men. Thirty or forty years ago, the Spaniards had a mission there, but broke it up, and moved it to Nacogdoches; they talk of resettling it, and speak in the highest terms of the country. Mayes.—Live on a large creek, called St. Gabriel, on the bay of St. Bernard, near the mouth of Gaudaloupe river; are estimated at two hundred men; never at peace with the Spaniards, towards whom they are said to possess a fixed hatred; but profess great friendship for the French, to whom they have been strongly attached since Monsieur de Salle landed in their neighborhood. The place where there is a talk of the Spaniards opening a new port, and making a settlement, is near them, where the party, with the Governor of St. Antoine, who were there last fall to examine it, say they found the remains of a French block-house. Some of the cannon now at Labahie are said to have been brought from that place, and known by the engravings now to be seen on them. The French speak highly of these Indians, for their extreme kindness and hospitality to all Frenchmen who have been amongst them. Have a language of their own, but speak Attakapas, which is the language of their neighbors the Carankouas; they have likewise a way of conversing by signs. Carankouas.—Live on an island, or peninsula, in the bay ofSt. Bernard, in length about ten miles, and five in breadth; the soil extremely rich and pleasant, on one side of which there is a high bluff or mountain of coal, which has been on fire for many years, affording always a light at night, ami a strong thick smoke by day, by which vessels are sometimes deceived, and left on the shoaly coast, which shoals are said to extend nearly out sight of land. From this burning coal there is emitted a gummy substance, the Spaniards call Chcta, which is thrown on the shore by the surf, and collected by them in considerable quantities, which they are fond of chewing; it lias the appearance and consistence of pitch, of a strong aromatic, anti not disagreeable smell. These' Indians are irreconcileable enemies to the Spaniards, always at war with them, and kill them whenever they can. The Spaniards call them cannibals, but the French give them a different character, who have always been treated kindly by them, since Monsieur de Salle, and his party, were in their neighborhood. They are said to be five hundred men strong; but I have not been able to estimate their numbers from any very accurate information; in a short time, expect to be well informed. They speak the Attakapas language, are friendly and kind to all other Indians, and, I presume, are much like all others, notwithstanding what the Spaniards say of them, for nature is every where the same. Last summer an old Spaniard came to me from Labahie. a journey of about 500 miles, to have a barked arrow taken out of his shoulder, that one of these Indians bad shot in it. I found it under bis shoulder blade, near nine inches, and had to cut a new place to get at the point of it, in order to get it out the contrary way from that in which it had entered. It was made of a piece of an iron hoop, with wings like a fluke and an inche. Cances, are a very numerous nation, consisting of a great many different tribes, occupying different parts of the country, from the bay of St. Bernard, across river Grande, towards La VeraCruz. They are not friendly to the Spaniards, and generally kill them when they have an opportunity. They are attached to the French; are good hunters, principally using the bow. They are very particular in their dress, which is made of neatly dressed leather; the women wear a long loose robe, resembling that of a Franciscan friar: nothing but their heads and feet are to be seen. The dress of the men is straight leather leggins, resembling pantaloons, and a leather hunting shirt or frock. No estimate can be made of their number. Thirty or forty years ago. the Spaniards used to make slaves of them when they could take them; a considerable number of them were brought to Natchitoches, and sold amongst the French inhabitants, tit forty or fifty dollars a head, and a number of them are still living here, but are now free. About twenty years ago. an order came from the King of Spain that no more Indians should be made slaves, and those that were enslaved should be emancipated; after which, some of the women, who had been servants in good families, and taught spinning, sewing, See. as well as managing household affairs, married natives of the country, and became respectable, well behaved women; and have now, grown up. decent families of children, have a language peculiar to themselves, and are understood by signs by all others. They are in amity with all other Indians except the Hietuns. Tanka ways, or Tanks, as the French call them, have no land, nor claim the exclusive right to any. nor have any particular place of abode, but are always moving, alternately occupying the country watered by the Trinity, Braces, and Colerado, towards Santa Fe. Resemble in their dress the Cances and Hietans: but all in one horde or tribe. Their number of men is estimated at about two hundred; are good hunters; kill buffalo and deer with the bow; have the best breed of horses; are alternately friends and enemies of the Spaniards. An old trader lately informed me, that he had received five thousand deer skins Irom them in one year, exclusive of tallow, rugs, and tongues. They plant nothing, but live upon wild fruits and flesh. Are strong athletic people, and excellent horsemen. Tawakexoes, or Three Canes. They are called by both names indifferently, live on the west side of the Braces, but are often, for months at a time, lower down than their usual place of residence, in the great plain on the Tortuga, or Turtle, called so, from its being a hill in the prairie, which, at a distance, appears in the form of a Turtle, upon which there is some remarkable springs of water. Their usual residence is about two hundred miles to the westward of Nacogdoches, towards Santa Fe. They are estimated at two hundred men; are good hunters; have guns, but hunt principally with the bow; are supplied with goods from Nacogdoches, and pay for them in rugs, tongues, tallow, and skins. They speak the same language of the Fanis, or Towiaches, and pretend to have descended from the same ancestors. Pams, or Towiaches. The French call them, Fanis, and the Spaniards Towiaches; the. latter is the proper Indian name. They live on the south bank of the Red river, by the course of the river upwards of eight hundred miles above Natchitoches, and by land, by the nearest path, is estimated at about three hundred and forty. They have two towns near together; the lower town, where the chief lives, is called Witcheta, and the other is called Towaaliack. They call their present chief the Great Bear: they are at war with the Spaniards, hut friendly to those French and American hunters who have lately been among them: they are, likewise, at war with the Usages, as are every other nation. For many hundreds of miles around them, the country is rich prairie, covered with luxuriant grass, which is green, summer and winter, with skirls of wood on the river hank, by the springs and creeks. They have many horses and mules; they raise more corn, pumpkins, beans, and tobacco, than they want for their own consumption; the surplusage they exchange with the Hietans, for buttido rugs, horses, and mules; the pumpkins they cut round in their sln eds, and when it is in a state of dryness, that it is so tough it will not break, but bend, they plat and work it into large mats, in which state they sell it to the Hietans, who, as they travel, cut off, and eat it, as they want it. Their tobacco they manufacture and cut as fine as tea. which is put into leather bags of a certain si'/.e, and is, likewise, an article of trade. They have hut lew guns, and very little ammunition; what they have they keep for war. and hunt with the bow; their meat is principally buffalo; seldom kill a deer, though they are so plenty they come into their villages, and about their houses, like a domestic animal. Elk. hear, wolves, antelope, and wild hogs, are likewise plenty within their country, and white rabbits or hares,as well as the common rabbit; white hears sometimes come down among them, and wolves of all colors. The men go entirely naked, and the women nearly so.jonly wearing a small flap, of a piece of skin. They have a number of Spaniards amongst them, of a fair complexion, taken from the settlement ot Santa Fe when they were children, who live as they do, and have no knowledge of where they came from. Their language differs from that of any other nation, the Tawakenoes excepted. Their present number of men is estimated at about four hundred. A great number of them, four years ago, were swept oft-by the small pox. Hietans or Cojianciies, who are likewise called by both names, have no fixed place of residence; have neither towns nor villages—divided into so may different hordes or tribes, that they have scarcely knowledge of one another. No estimate of their numbers can well be made; they never remain in the same place more than a few days, but follow the buffalo, the ilesh of which is their principal food; some of them occasionally purchase of the Fanis, corn, beans, and pumpkins, but they are so numerous, any quantity of these articles the Fanis are able to supply them with, must make but a small proportion of their food. They have tents made of neatly dressed skins, fashioned in form of a cone, sufficiently roomy for a family of ten or twelve persons: those of the chiefs will contain, occasionally, fifty or sixty persons. When they stop, their tents are pitched in very exact order, so as to form regular streets ami squares, which, in a few minutes, has the appearance of a town, raised, as it were, by enchantment And they are equally dexterous in striking their tents and preparing for a march, when the signal is given; to every tent, two horses or mules arealloted, one to carry the tent and the other the poles or sticks, which are neatly made of red cedar; they all travel on horseback; their horses they never turn loose to graze, hut always keep them tied with a long cabras or halter, and every two or three days, they are obliged to move, on account of all the grass near them being eaten up, they have such numbers of horses. They are good horsemen, and have good horses, most of which are bred by themselves, and being accustomed, when very young, to he handled, they are remaikably docile and gentle. They sometimes catch wild horses, which are every where amongst them, in immense droves; they hunt down the buffalo on horseback, and kill them, either with the bow ora sharp stick like a spear, which they carry in their hands. They are generally at war with the Spaniards, after committing depredations upon the inhabitants of Santa Fe and St. Antoine, but have always been friendly and civil to any French or Americans who have been amongst them. They are strong and athletic, and the elderly men as fat as though they had lived upon English beef and porter. It is said, the man who kills a buffalo catches the blood and drinks it while warm; they likewise eat the liver raw, before it is cold, and use the gall by way of sauce. They are, for savages, uncommonly cleanly in their persons; the dress of the women is a long loose robe, that reaches from their chin to the ground, tied round with a fancy sash or girdle, all made of neatly dressed leather, on which they paint figures of different colors and significations. The dress of the men is close leather pantaloons and hunting shirt or truck of the same. They never remain long enough in the same place to plant any thing; the small Cayenne pepper grows spontaneously in the country, with which, and some wild herbs and fruits, particularly a bean that grows in great plenty on a small tree resembling a willow, called Mitsketo, the women cook their buffalo beef, in a manner that would be grateful to an English squire. They alternately occupy the immense space of country, from the Trinity and Braees, crossing the Red river, to the heads of Arkansas and Missouri, to river Grande, and beyond it, about Santa Fe, and over the dividing ridge on the waters of the Western ocean, where, they say, they have seen large pirogues, with masts to them, in describing which, they make a drawing of a ship, with all its sails and rigging; and iliey describe a place where they have seen vessels ascending a river, over which was a draw bridge, that opened to give them a passage. Their native language of sounds differs from' the language of any other nation, and none can either speak or understand it; but they have a language by signs, that all Indians understand, and by which, they converse much among themselves. They have a number of Spanish men and women among them, who are slaves, and who, they made pri- soners when young. An elderly gentleman, now living at Natchitoches, who, some years ago, carried on a trade with the Hietans, a few days ago related to me the following story: About twenty years ago, a party of these Indians passed over river Grande to Chawawa, the residence of the Governor General of what is called the Five Internal Provinces, lay in ambush for an opportunity, and made prisoner the Governor’s daughter, a young lady going in her coach to mass, and brought her off. The Governor sent a message to him, (my informant) with a thousand dollars, for the purpose of recovering his daughter. He immediately despatched a confidential trader, then in his employ, with the one thousand dollars in merchandise, who repaired to the nation, found her, and purchased her ransom, but, to his great surprise, she refused to return with him to her father, and sent by him, the following message: That the Indians had disfigured her face, by tattooing it according to their fancy and ideas of beauty, and a young man of them had taken her for his wife, by whom she believed hel* self pregnant; that she had become reconciled to their mode of life, and was well treated by her husband; and, that she should be more unhappy by returning to her father, under these circumstances, than by remaining where she was. Which message was conveyed to her father, who rewarded the trader by a present of three hundred dollars more, for his trouble and fidelity, and his daughter is now' living with her Indian husband in the nation, by whom she has three children. Natchitoches, formerly lived where the town of Natchitoches is now situated, which took its name from them. An elderly French gentleman lately informed me, he remembered when they were six hundred men strong. I believe it is now ninety-eight years since the French first established themselves at Natchitoches; ever since, these Indians have been their steady and Faithful friends. After the massacre of the French inhabitants of Natchez, by the Natchez Indians, in 1728, those Indians fled from the French, after being reinforced, and came up Red river, and camped about six miles below the town of Natchitoches, near the river, by the side of a small lake of clear water, and erected a mound of considerable size, where it now remains. Monsieur St. Dennic, a French Canadian, was then commandant at Natchitoches; the Indians called him the Big-foot; were fond of him, for he was a brave man. St. Dennie, with a few French soldiers and what militia he could muster, joined by the Natchitoches Indians, attacked (he Natchez in their camp, early in the morning; they defended themselves desperately for six hours, but were at length totally defeated by St. Dennie, and what of them that were not killed in battle, were drove into the lake, where the last of them perished, and the Natchez, as a nation, became extinct. The lake is now called by no other name than the Natchez lake. There are now remaining of the Natchitoches, but twelve men and nineteen women, who live in a village, about twenty-five miles, by land, above the town which bears their name, near a lake called by the French, Lac (le Muire. Their original language is the same as the Yattassee, but speak Caddo, and most of them French. The French inhabitants have great respect for this nation, and a number of very decent families have a mixture of their blood in them. They claim but a small tract of land, on which they live, and. I am informed, have the same rights to it from Government, that other inhabitants, in the neighborhood, have. They are gradually wasting away; the small pox has been their great destroyer; they still preserve their Indian dress and habits; raise corn, and those vegetables common in their neighborhood. Boluscas, are emigrants from near Pensacola; they came to Red river, about forty-two years ago. with some French families, who left that country about the time Pensacola wras taken possession of by the English. They were then a considerably numerous tribe, and have generally embraced the Roman Catholic religion, and w ere very highly esteemed by the French. They settled first at Avoyelles; then moved higher up to Rapide Bayou, about forty miles from Natchitoches, where they now live, and are reduced to about thirty in number. 'I heir native language is peculiar to themselves, but speck Mobilian, which is spoken by all the Indians, from the east side of the Mississippi. They are honest, harmless, and friendly people. Apalachies, are likewise emigrants from West Florida, from off the river whose name they bear; came over to Red river, about the same time the Boluscas did, and have since lived on the river, above Bayou Rapide. No nation has been more highly esteemed by the French inhabitants; no complaints against them are ever heard; there are only fourteen men remaining; have their own language, but speak French and Mobilian. Alabamas, are likewise from West Florida, off the] Alabama river, and came to Red river about the same time of the Boluscas and Apalachies. Part of them have lived on Red river, about sixteen miles above the Bayou Rapide, till last year, when most of this party, of about thirty men, went up Red river, and have settled themselves near the Caddoquies, where, I am informed, they last year made a good crop of corn. The Caddoes are friendly to them, and have no objection to their settling there; they speak the Creek and Choctaw languages, and Mobilian; most of them French, and some of them English. There is another party of them, whose village is on a small creek in Opelousas district, about thirty miles northwest form the church of Opelousas; they consist of about forty men; they have lived at the same place ever since they came from Florida; are said to be increasing a little in numbers for a few years past; 'they raise corn, have horses, hogs, and cattle, and are harmless, quiet people. Conchattas, are almost the same people as the Alabamas, but came over only ten years ago; first lived on Bayou Chico, in Opelousas district, but, four years ago, moved to the river Sabine, settled themselves on the cast bank, where they now live, in nearly a south direction from Natchitoches, and distant about eighty miles. They cal! their number of men one hundred and sixty, but say, if they were all together, they would amount to two hundred; several families of them live in detached settlements; they are good hunters, and game is plenty about w here they are. A few years ago, a small party of them were here, consisting of fifteen persons, men, women, and children, who were on their return from a bear hunt up Sabine; they told me, they had killed one hundred and eighteen, but this year, an uncommon number of bears have come down; one man alone, on Sabine, during the summer and fall hunting, killed four hundred deer; sold his skins at forty dollars a hundred. The bears, this year, are not so fat as common; they usually yield from eight to twelve gallons of oil, which never sells for less than a dollar a gallon, and the skin a dollar more; no great quantity of the meat is saved; what the hunters don’t use when out, they generally give to their dogs. The Conchattas are friendly with all other Indians, and speak well of their neighbors, the Carankouas, who, they say, live about eighty miles south of them, on the bay, which, I believe, is the nearest point to the sea. from Natchitoches. A few families of the Choctaw's have lately settled near them, from Bayou Bceuf. The Conchattas speak Creek, which is their native language, and Choctaw; and several of them, English, and one or two of them can read it a little. Pacaxas, are a small tribe of about thirty men, who live on Quelqueshoc river, which falls into the bay, between Attakapas and Sabine, which heads in a prairie called Cooko prairie, about forty ndles southwest of Natchitoches. These people are likewise emigrants from West Florida, about forty years ago; their village is about fifty miles southeast of the Conchattas; are said to be increasing a little in number; quiet, peaceable, and friendly people; their own language differs from any other, but speak Mobilian. Attakapas.—This word, I am informed, when translated into English, means man-eater, but it is no more applicable to them than any other Indians. The district they live in, is called after them; their village is about 20 miles to the westward of the Attakapas church, tow'ards Quelqueshoc; their number of men is about fifty; but .some Runicas and Iluinas, who have married in their nation, and live writh them, make them altogether about ■eighty: they are peaceable and friendly to every body; labor occasionally for the white inhabitants; raise their own corn; have cattle and hogs; their language, and the Carankouas, is the same; they were at, or near, where they now live, when that part of the country was first discovered by the French. Opelousas.—It is said the word Appalousa, in the Indian language, means black-head, or black-skull. They are aborigines of the district called by their name; their village is about fifteen miles west from the Opelousas church; have about forty men; their native language differs from all others; understand Attakapas, and speak French; plant corn; have cattle and hogs. Tunicas.—These People formerly lived on the Bayou Tunica, above point Coupee, on the Mississippi, East side; live now at Avoyelles; do not, at present, exceed twenty-five men. Their native language is peculiar to themselves, but speak Mobilian; are employed occasionally by the inhabitants as boatmen, &c.; in amity with all other People, and gradually diminishing in numbers. Pascagoulas.—Live in a small village on Red river, about sixty miles below Natchitoches; are emigrants from Pascagoula river, in West Florida; twenty-five men only of them remaining; speak Mobilian, but have a language peculiar to themselves: most of them speak and understand French; they raise good crops of corn, and garden vegetables; have cattle, horses, and poultry plenty; their horses are much like the poorer kind of French inhabitants on the liver, and appear to live about as well. Tenisaws, are likewise emigrants from the Tensaw river, that falls into the bay of Mobile: have been on Red river about forty years; are reduced to about twenty-live men. Their village is within one mile of the Pascogoulas, on the opposite side: but have lately sold their lands, and have, or are about moving, to Bayou Bceuf, about twenty-five miles south from where they lately lived. All speak French anti Mobilian: and live much like their neighbors, the Pascagoulas. Ciiactoos.—Live on Bayou Boeuf, about ten miles to the southward of Bayou Rapide, on Red river, towards Opelousas; a small, honest People; are aborigines of the country where they live; of men about thirty, diminishing; have their own peculiar tongue; speak Mobilian. The lands they claim on Bayou Bceuf, are inferior to no part oi Louisiana, in depth and richness of soil, growth of timber, pleasantness of surface, and goodness of water. The Bayou Bceuf falls into the Chatfeli, and discharges through Opelousas and Attakapas, into Vermillion bay. W ashas.—When the French first came into the Mississippi, this nation lived on an island, to the southwest of New Orleans, called Barataria, and were the first tribe of Indians they became acquainted with, and were always friends; they afterwards lived on Bayou La Fourche: and from being a considerable nation, are now- reduced to five persons only, two men and three women, who are scattered in French families; have been many years extinct as a nation, and their language lost. Choctaw's.—There are a considerable number of this nation on the West side of the Mississippi, who have not been home for several years; about twelve miles above the post on Ouachita, on that river, there is a small village of them, of about thirty men. who have lived there for several years, and made corn; and likewise on Bayou Chico, in the northern part of the district of Opelousas; there is another village of them, of about fifty men, who have been there for about nine years, and say they have the Governor of Louisiana's permission to settle there. Besides these, there are rambling hunting parties of them, to be met with all over lower Louisiana. They are at war with the Caddoquies, and liked by neither red nor w hite People. ■ Arkansas.—Live on the Arkansas river, south side, in three villages, about twelve miles above the post or station. The name of the first village is Tawanima. second Ousolu, and the third Ocupu; in all. it is believed, they do not at present exceed one hundred men, and diminishing. They are at war with the Osages. but friends with all other People, white and red; are the original proprietors of the country on that river, to all which they claim, for about 300 miles above them, to the junction of the river Cadron with Arkansas: above this fork the Osages claim; their language is Osage. They generally raise corn to sell; are called honest and friendly people. The forementioned, are all the Indian tribes that I have any knowledge of. or can obtain an account of, in Louisiana. south of the river Arkansas, between the Mississippi and the river Grand: at Avoyelles, there did live a considerable tribe of that name, but, as far as I can learn, have been extinct lor many years, two or three women excepted, who did lately live among the French inhabitants at Washita. There are a few of the Humas still living on the east side of the Mississippi, in Insussees parish, below' Manchac, but scarcely exist as a nation. That there are errors in these sketches, is not to be doubted; but in all cases out of my own personal knowledge, 1 have endeavored to procure the best information, which I have faithfully related; and I am confident, any errors that do exist, are too unimportant to atfectthe object for which they are intended. I am, sir, &c. &c. JOHN SIBLEY. General II. Dearborn. Xatcliitochcs, April 5, 1805. Natchitoches, 10th April, 1805. Sir: You request me to give you some account of Red river, and the country adjacent; I will endeavor to comply with your request, to the best of my knowledge and capacity; my personal know ledge of it, is only, from its mouth to about seventy or eighty miles above Natchitoches, being by the course of the river near four hundred miles. After that, what I can say of it is derived from information from others, on whose v eracity I have great reliance, principally from Mr. Francis Gra.ppe, who is my assistant, and interpreter of Indian languages: whose father was a French officer, and superintendent of Indian affairs, at a post, or station occupied by France, where they kept some soldiers, and had a factory, previous to the cession of Louisiana to Spain; situated nearly five hundred miles, by the course of the river, above Natchitoches, where he, my informant, was born, and lived upwards of thirty years; his time, during which,being occupied alternately as an assistant to bis father, an Indian trader and hunter; with the advantage ol some learning, and a very retentive meinorj, acquired an accurate knov.dedge of the river, as well as the languages of all the different Indian tribes in Louisiana; which, with having been Indian interpreter, for the Spanish Government, for many years past, and (I believe) deservedly esteemed by the Indians, and all others, a man of strict integrity, has, formally years, and does nowr, possess their entire confidence, and a very extensive influence over them. And I have invariably found, that whatever information I have received from him, has been confirmed by every other intelligent person having a knowledge of the same, with whom I have conversed: Note.—Contrary to geographical rules, as I ascended the river, I called the right hank the northern one, and the left the southern. The confluence of Red river with the Mississippi is, by the course of the latter, estimated about two hundred and twenty miles from New' Orleans. Descending the Mississippi, after passing the Spanish line at the thirty-first degree of north latitude, it makes a remarkable turn to the westward, or nearly northwest, for some distance before you arrive at the mouth of Red river, as though, notwithstanding the immense quantity of its waters, already, from its almost numberless tributary streams, it was still desirous of a farther augmentation, by hastening its union with Red river, (which perhaps is second only in dignity to it) that they might trom thence flow on, and join the ocean together, which for many leagues is forced to give place.to Us mighty current. But there are reasons for believing the Red river did not always unite with the Mississippi, as it does at present; and that no very great length of time has elapsed, since the Mississippi left its ancient bed, some miles to the eastward, and took its course west-wardly, for the purpose of intermarrying with Red river. The mouth of the Chatfali, which is now, properly speaking. one of the outlets of the river Mississippi to the ocean, is just below', in sight of the junction of Red river with the Mississippi, and, from its resemblance to Red river, in si/.e, growth on its banks, appearance and texture of soil, and differing from that of the Mississippi, induces strongly the belief, that {the Chaftali was once but the continuation of Red river to the ocean; .and that it had in its bed no connexion with the Mississippi. There is no doubt but the Mississippi has alternately occupied different places in the low ground, through which it meanders almost from the high lands of one side, to those of the other, for the average space of nearly thirty miles. These two great rivers, happening to flow' from a distance through the same mass of swamp, that annually is almost all inundated, it is not extraordinary that their channels should find their way together: the remarkable bend of the 92 * Mississippi at this place, to the westward, seems to have been for the express purpose of forming this union; after which, it returns to its former course. In the month of March, 1803, 1 ascended Red river from its mouth to Natchitoches, in an open boat, unless, when I chose to land, and walk across a point, or by the beauty of the river bank, the pleasantness of its groves, or the variety of its shrubs and flowers, I was invited ashore to gratify or please my curiosity. On entering the mouth of the river, found its waters turgid, of a red color, and of a brackish taste; and as the Mississippi was then falling, and Red river rising, found a current from it's mouth upwards, varying considerably in places, but averaging about two miles an hour, for the first hundred miles, which at that time I found to be about the same in the Mississippi; but when that river is high, and Red river low, there is very little current in the latter, for sixty or seventy miles. The river for that distance is very crooked, increasing the distance by it, from a straight line, more than two-thirds, the general course of it nearly west: that I was able to ascertain, from hearing the morning gun at fort Adams, for three or four mornings alter entering the liver, which was not at the greatest height by about fourteen feet, and all the low grounds, lor nearly seventy miles, entirely overflowed, like those of the Mississippi, which in fact is but a continuation of the same. Some places appeared, by the high water mark on the trees, to overflow not more than two or three feet, particularly the right bank, below the mouth of Black river, and the left bank above it; the growth, on the lowest places, willow and cotton wood, but on the highest, handsome oaks,-swamp hickory, ash, grapevines, &c. I made my calculation of our rate of ascent, and-distances up the river, by my watch, noting carefully with my pencil the minute of our stops and settings off, the inlets and outlets, remarkable bends in the river, and whatever I observed any way remarkable. About six miles from the mouth of the river, left side, there is a bayou, as it is called, comes in, that communicates with a lake called lake Long, which by another bayou communicates again with the river, through which, when there is a swell in the river, boats can pass,anti cut offabout thirty miles, being only fourteen or fifteen through it, and about forty-five by the course of the river; and through the lake there is very little or no current, but the passage is intricate and difficult to find; a stranger should not attempt it without a pilot; people have been lost in it for several days; but not difficult for one acquainted; we,having no pilot on board to be depended on, kept the river. From the mouth of Red river, to the mouth of Black river, I made it thirty-one miles; the water of Black river is clear, and when contrasted with the water of Red river, lias a black appearance. From the mouth of Black river, Red river makes a regular twining to the left, for about eighteen miles, called the Grand Bend, forming a segment of nearly three-fourths of a circle, when you arrive at the bayou, that leads into lake Long, which perhaps is in a right line, not exceeding fifteen miles from the mouth of the river. From bayou lake Long to Avoyelles landing, called Baker’s landing, I made thirty-three miles, and the river is remarkably crooked. At this place the guns at fort Adams are distinctly heard, and the sound appears to be but little south of east; we came through a bayou called Silver bayou, that cutoff’, we understand, six miles; ’twas through the bayou about four miles. Until we arrived at Baker’s landing, saw no spot of ground that did riot overflow the high water marks, generally from three to fifteen feet'above its banks. After passing Black river, the edge of the banks near the river are highest; the land falls from the river back. At Baker’s landing I went ashore. I understood, from Baker’s landing accross the point, to La Glass’ landing, was only three or four miles, and by water fifteen; but I found it six at least, and met with some difficulty in getting from where T landed to the high land, at Baker’s house, for water; though at low water, it is a dry cart road, and less than a mile. 1 found Baker and his family very hospitable and kind; Mr. Baker told me he was a native of Virginia, and had lived there upwards of thirty years. He was living-on a tolerable good high piece of land, not prairie, but joining it; after leaving Baker’s house, was soon in sight of the prairie, which I understood is about forty miles in circumference, longer than it is wide, very level, only a few clumps of trees to be seen, all covered with good grass. The inhabitants arc settled all around the out edge of it, by the woods, their houses facing inwards, and cultivate the prairie land; though the soil, when turned up with the plough, has a good appearance, what I could discover by the old corn and cotton stalks, they made but indifferent crops; the timbered land that I saw cleared and planted, produced the best; the prairie is better for grass than for planting. The inhabitants have considerable stocks of cattle, which appear to be their principal dependence, and I was inlormed their beef.is of a superior quality; they have likewise good pork; hogs live very well; the timbered country all round the prairie is principally oak, thatproducesgood mast for hogs; corn is generally scarce; tlieyraise .no wheat, for they have no mills. I was informed that the lower end of the prairie, that I did not see, was much the richest land, and the inhabitants lived better, and were more wealthy: they are a mixture of French, Irish, and Americans, generally poor and ignorant. Avoyelles, at high water, is an island, elevated thirty or forty feet above high water mark; the quantity of timbered land exceeds that of the prairie, which is likewise pretty level, but scarcely a second-quality of soil. La Glass’ landing, as it is called, I found about a mile and a half from the upper end of the prairie; the high lands bluff to the river.. After leaving this place, found the banks rise higher and higher on each side, and fit for settlements; on the right side, pine woods sometimes in sight; I left the boat again, about eight miles from La Glass’ landing, right side, walked two and an half miles across a point, to Mr. Hoome's; round the point is called sixteen miles. I Found the lands through which I passed, high, moderately hilly; the soil a good second quality, clay, timber, large oak, hickory, some short leaved pine, and several small streams of clear, running water. This description of lands extended back five or six miles, and bounded by open pine woods, which continue for thirty* miles to Ocatahola. I found Mr. Hoome’s house on a high bluff’, very near-the river; his plantation the same description of lands through which I had passed, producing good corn, cotton, and tobacco, and lie told me he had tried it inwheat, which succeeded well, but having no mills to manufacture it, had only made the experiment; Mr. Iloomes told me all the lands round his, for many miles, were vacant. On the.south side there is a large-body of rich, low grounds, extending to the borders on Opelousas, watered and drained by Bayou Robert and Bayou Boeuf, two handsome streams of clearwater, that rise in the high lands, between Red river and Sabine, and! after meandering through this immense mass.of low grounds, of thirty or forty miles square, fall into the Chaffeli, to the southward of Avoyelles: I believe, in point, of soil, growth of timber,goodness of water, and conveniency to navigation, there is not a more valuable body of land in this part of Louisiana. From Mr. lloome’sto the mouth of Rapide Bayou, is by the river thirty-five miles: a few scattering settlements on the right side, but none on the left; the right is preferred to settle on, on account of their stocks being convenient to the high lands; but the settlers on the right side own the lands on the left side too. The lands on the Bayou Rapide are the same quality as those on Bayou Robert and Boeuf, and in fact are a continuation of the same body of lands. Bayou Rapide is somewhat in the form of a half moon, the two points or horns meeting the river about twenty miles from each other; the length of the Bayou is about thirty miles; on the back of it there is a large Bayou falls in, on which there is a saw-mill, very advantageously situated in respect to a never failing supply of water, plenty of timber, and the plank can be taken from the mill tail by water. This Bayou is excellent water; rises in the pine woods, and discharges itself each way into the river by both ends of Bayou Rapide. Boats cannot pass through the Bayou from the river,'to the river again, on account of rafts of timber choking the upper end of it; but can enter the lower end, and ascend it more than half through it. On the lower end of the Bayou, on each side, is the principal Rapide settlement, as it is called. No country whatever can exhibit handsomer plantations or better lands. I j I r , The Rapide is a fall or shoal, occasioned by a soft rock in the bed of the river, that extends from side to side; over which, for about five months in the year, viz: from July to December, there- is not sufficient water for boats to pass without lightening; but at all other seasons it is the same as any other part of the river. This rock, or hard clay, for it resembles the latter almost as much as the former, is so soft it may be cut away with a penknife, or any sharp instrument, and scarcely turn the edge, and extends up and down the river but a few yards; and I have heard several intelligent persons give it as their opinion, that the extraordinary expense and trouble the inhabitants were at, in one year, in getting loaded boats over this shoal, would be more than sufficient to cut a passage through it:, but it happens at a seaaon oi the year when the able planters are occupied at home, and would make no use of the river, were there no obstructions in it; but, at any rate, the navigation of the river is clear a longer proportion ofthe year than the rivers in the northen countries are clear of ice. But this obstruction is certainly removable at a very trifling expense, in comparison to the importance of having itdone; and nothing but the nature of the Government we have lately emerged from, can be assigned ns a reason for its not having been effected long ago. After passing the rapids, there are very few settlements to be seen, on the main river, for about twenty mile?., though both sides appeared, to me, to be capable of making as valuable settlements as any on the river; we arrive, then, at the Indian villages, on both sides situated exceedingly pleasant, and on the best lands. After passing which, you arrive at a large, beautiful plantation, of Mr. Gil lard; the house is on a point of a high pine woods bluff, close to the river, sixty or seventy feet above the common surface of the country, overlooking, on the east, or opposite side, very extensive lields, of low grounds, in high cultivation, and a long reach of the river up and down ; and there is an excellent spring of water issues from the bluff, on which the house is situated, from an aperture in the rock, that seems to have been cloven on purpose for it to flow; and, a small distance, back of the house, there is a lake of clear water, abounding with fish in summer, and fowl in w inter. 1 have seen, in all my life, very few more beautiful or advantageously situated places. Six miles above Mr. Gillard’s, you arrive at the small village of Bolusca Indians, where the river is divided into two channels, forming an island of about fifty miles in length, and three or four in breadth; the right hand division is called the Rigula de Bondieu, on which are no settlements? but, I am informed, will admit of being well settled; the left hand division is the boat channel, at present, to Natchitoches; the other is, likewise, bootable. Ascending the left hand branch, for about twenty-four miles, we pass a thick settlement, and a number of wealthy inhabitants; this is called the River-cane settlement, called so, I believe, from the banks, some years ago, being a remarkably thick cane brake. * ■ After passing this settlement, of about forty families, the river divides again, forming another island, of about thirty miles in length, and from two to four in breadth, called the Isle Brevet, after a reputable old man, now living in it, who first settled it. This island is sub-divided by a bayou, that communicates irom one river to the other, called also Bayou Brevel. The middle division of the river is called Little river, and is thickly settled, and the best channel; the westward division of the river is called False river; is navigable, but not settled; the banks are too low; it passes through a lake called Lac.iccussu. W hen you arrive at Natchitoches, you find it a small, irregular, and meanly built village, half a dozen houses excepted; on the west side of that division of the river it is on, the high pine and oak woods approach within tw o or three hundred yards-of the river. In The village are about forty families; twelve or fifteen are merchants, or traders, nearly all French. The fort built by our troops, since their arrival, called fort Claiborne, is situated on a small hill, one street from the river, and about thirty feet higher than the river banks; all the hill is occupied by the fort and barracks, and does not exceed two acres of ground. The southern and eastern prospects front it are very beautiful; one has an extensive view of the fields and habitations down the river, and the other a similar view over the river, and of the whole village. This town, thirty or forty-years ago, was much larger than at present, and situated on a hill about half a mile from its present site; then, most of the tamilies of the district lived in the tow n; but finding it inconvenient, on account of the stocks and farms, they fileil off. one after another, and settled up and down the river; the merchants and trading people, finding being on the bank of the river more convenient for loading and unloading their boats,' left the hill on that account; and others, finding the river ground much superior for gardens, to which they are in the habit of paying great attention, followed the merchants; after them, the priests and commandant; then, the church and jail, (or Callaboose) and now nothing of the old town is left; hut the form of their gardens and some ornamental trees. It is now a very-extensive common of several hundred acres, entirely tufted with clover, and covered with sheep and cattle. The hill is a stiff clay, and used to make miry streets; the river soil, though much richer, is of a sandy loose texture; the streets are neither miry, nor very dirty. Our wells do not afford ns good water, and the river water, in summer, is too brackish to drink, and never clear; our springs are about half a mile back from the river ; but the inhabitants, many of them, have large cisterns, and use, principally, rain water, which is preferred to the spring water; the planters, along on the river, generally, use ram water; though, w hen the river is high, and the water taken up and settled, in large eartltern jars, (which the Indian women make, of good quality, and at a moderate price) it can be drank tolerably well, but makes bad tea. Near Natchitoches, there are two large lakes, one within a mile, the other six miles, to the nearest parts; one of them is fifty or sixty miles in circumference, the other upwards of thirty; these lakes rise and fall with the fixer. When the river is rising, the bayous that connect with the lakes run into the lakes, like a mill tail, till the lakes are filled; and when the river is falling, it is the same the contrary way, just like the tide, but only annual. On these creeks good mills might be erected; but the present inhabitants know nothing of mills by water, yet have excellent cotton gins, worked by horses. I do not know a single mechanic, in the district, who is a native of it, one tailor excepted; every thing of the kind is done by strangers, and mostly Americans. Though Natchitoches has been settled almost one hundred years, it is not more than twelve or fifteen years since they ever had a plough, or a flat to cross the river with; both which were introduced by an Irish Pennsylvanian, under a similar opposition to the Copernican system. "Pis almost incredible the quantity of fish and fowl these lake’s supply; it is not uncommon, in winter, fora single man to kill front two to four hundred fowl in one evening; they fly between sun-down and dark; the air is filled with them; they load and tire, as fastas they can. without taking any particitlaraiin, continuing at the same stand, till they think they have killed enough, and then pick up what they have killed; they consist of several kinds of duck, geese, brant, and swan. In summer, the quantities of fish are nearly in proportion; one Indian will, with a bow and arrow, sometimes, kill them faster, than another, with two horses, can bring them in; they weigh, some of them, thirty or forty pounds. The lakes, likewise, afford plenty of shells for lime, and, at low-water, the greater of them is a most luxuriant meadow, where the inhabitants fatten their horses. All around these, above high water mark, there is a body of rich laud, generally wide enough for a field; on the bank of one of them there is plenty of stone coal and several quarries of tolerable good building stone; at high water, boats can go out of the river into them. Similar lakes are found, all along Red river, for five or six hundred miles; which, besides the uses already mentioned, nature seems to have provided as reservoirs for the immense quantity of water beyond what the banks of the river will contain; otherwise, no part of them coultl be inhabited; the low grounds, from hill to hill, would be inundated. _ About tw elve miles north of Natchitoches, oil the north east side of the river, there is a large lake, called Lac Moir; the bayou of it communicates to the Rigula de Bondieu, opposite Natchitoches, which is beatable the greater part of the yerne Near this lake are the salt works, from xvhich all the salt, that is used in the district, is made; and which is made with so much ease that two old men, both of them cripples with ten or twelve old pots and kettles, have, for several years past, made an abundant supply of salt for the whole district; they inform me that they make six bushels per day ; 1 have not been at the place, but have a bottle of the' water, brought to liie, which I found nearly saturated; the salt is good; I never hail better bacon than I make, with it. lam informed there are twelve saline springs now open; and by digging for them, for aught any one knows, twelve hundred might be opened. A few months ago, Captain Burnet, of the Mississippi territory, coming to this place by Washington, came by the salt works, and purchased the right of one of the old men he found there, and has, lately, sent up a boat, with some large kettles and some negroes, under the direction of his sou: and expects, when they get all in order, to be able to make thirty or forty bushels a day. Captain Burnet is of opinion that he shall be able to supply the Mississippi territory, and the settlements on Mississippi, from Point Coupee, upw ards, low er than they can get it in New Orleans and bring it up. Cathartic salts and magnesia might, likewise, be made, in large quantities, if they understood it. The country all round the Saline and Black lake is vacant; and from thence to Washita, a distance of 120 miles, which, 1 am informed, affords considerable quantities of well timbered good uplands, and well watered. There is a small stream, \ve cross, on the Washita road, the English call Little river, the French Bogdimona, affording a wide rich bottom; this stream falls into the Acataliola lake; from thence to W ashita, it is called Acatahola river; its course is eastwardly, and falls into Washita, near the mouth of Tensaw, where the road, from Natchitoches to to Natchez, crosses it; from the confluence of these three rivers, downwards, it is called Black river, which falls into Red river, sixly miles Mow. There is a good salt spring near the Acatahola lake. Ascending Red river, above Natchitoches, in about three miles, arrive at the upper mouth of the Rigula de Bondieu; there are settlements all along, plantations adjoining. From the upper mouth of the RiguLt de Bondieu, the river is in one channel through the settlement of Grand Ecore, of about six miles; it is called Grand Ecore, (or, in English, the Great Bluff) being such an one on the left hand side, near one hundred feet high. The face, next the river, almost perpendicular, of a soft, white roclc; the top, a grand loam, of considerable extent, on which grow large oaks, hickory, black cherry, and grape vines. At the bottom of one of these bluffs, for there are two near each other, is a large quantity of stone-coal, and, near them, several springs of the best water in this part of .the country; and a lake of clear water within two hundred yards, bounded by a gravelly margin. I pretend to have no knowledge of military tactics, but think, from the river in this place being all in one channel, the goodness of the water, a high, heal thy country, and well timbered all round it, no height, near it, so high, its commanding the river, and a very public ferry just under it, and at a small expense, would be capable of great defence with a small force. The road from it to the westward, better than from Natchitoches, and, by land, only about five miles above it, and, near it, plenty of good building stone. These advantages it possesses beyond any other place, within my knowledge, on the river, for a strong fort, and safe place of deposite. Just above the bluff, the river makes a large bend to the right, and a long reach nearly due east and west by it; the bluff overlooks, on the opposite side, several handsome plantations. I have been induced, from the advantages this place appeared to me to possess, to purchase it. with four or five small settlements adjoining it, including both bluffs, the ferry, springs, and lake, the stone quarries, and coal: and a field of about five hundred acres of the best low grounds, on the opposite side. After leaving Grand Ecore, about a mile, on the east side, comes in a large bayou, from ,the Spanish lake, as it is called, boatable the greater part of the year. This lake is said to be about fifty miles in circumference, and rises and falls with the river, into which, from the river, the largest boats may ascend, and from it, up the mouths of several large bayous that fall into it, for some distance; one, in particular, called bayou Du pong, up which boats may ascend within one and a half mile of old fort Adaize. Leaving this bayou about two miles, arrive at a fork or division of the river; the left hand branch bears westwardly for sixty or 80 miles; the eastwardly meeting the branch it left, after forming an island of about one hundred miles long, and, in some places, nearly thirty miles wide. Six or seven years ago, boats used to pass this way into the main river again, its communication with which being above the great raft or obstruction; but it is.now choked, and requires a portage of three miles; but, at any season, boats can go from Natchitoches, about eighty miles, to the place called the point, where the French had a factory, and a small station of soldiers, to guard the Indian trade, and is now, undoubtedly, a very eligible situation for a similar establishment. The country bounded to the east and north, by this branch or division of the river, is called the bayou Pierre settlement, which was begun, and some of the lands granted, before Louisiana was ceded to Spain by France, and continued under the jurisdiction of the commandant of Natchitoches until about twenty years ago, when, by an agreement between a Mr. Vogene, the commandant of this place, and a Mr. Eliberbe, commandant at Natchitoches, the settlement called bayou Pierre was placed under the jurisdiction of the latter, and has so continued ever since. The settlement. 1 believe, contains about forty families, and, generally, they have large stocks of cattle; they supply us with our cheese entirely, and of a tolerable quality, and we get from them .some excellent bacon hams. The country is interspersed with prairies, resembling, as to richness, the river bottoms, and in size from five to five thousand acres. The hills are a good grey soil, and produce very well, and aft’ord beautiful situations. The creek called Bayou Pierre (Stony creek) passes through the settlement, and affords a number of good mill seats, and its bed and banks lined with a good kind of building stone; but no mills are erected on it. Some of the inhabitants have tried the uplands in wheat, which succeeded well; they are high, gently rolling, and rich enough; produce good corn, cotton, and tobacco. I was through the settlement in July last, and found good water, either from a spring or well, at every house. The inhabitants are ail French, one family excepted. A few miles to the westward, towards Sabine, there is a saline where the inhabitants go and make their salt. On the whole, for health, good water, good living, plenty of food, and every kind of animal, general conveniency, and handsome surface, I have seen few parts of the world more inviting to settlers. Returning back again to the fork of the main river we left, for the purpose of exploring the Bayou Pierre branch, we find irregular settlements, including Compti, where a few families are settled together on a hill near the river, northeast side. For about twenty miles, the river land is much the same every where; but the Compti settlement is more broken with bayous and lagoons than any place I am acquainted with on the river; and for want of about a dozen bridges, is inconvenient to get to, or travel through. The upper end ot this settlement is the last on the main branch of Red river, which, straight by land, does not exceed twenty-five miles above Natchitoches. At the Upper House, the great raft or jam of timber begins; this raft chokes the main channel for upwards of one hundred miles by the course of the river; not one entire jam from the beginning to the end of it, but only at the point, with places of several leagues that are clear. The river is very crooked, arid the low grounds are wide and rich; and I am informed no part of Red river will afford better plantations than along its banks by this raft, which is represented as being so important as to render the country above it of little value for settlements. This opinion is founded entirely upon incorrect information. The first or lowest part of the raft is at a point or bend in the river, just below the upper plantation; at which, on the right side, a large bayou, or division of the liver, called Bayou Clianno, comes in, Which is free of any obstructions; and, the greater part of the year, boats of any size may ascend it into lake Bistino. through which, to its communication with the lake, is only about three miles; the lake is about sixty miles long, ami lies nearly parallel with the river; from the upper end of which it communicates again with the river, by a bayou called Daichet, about forty miles above the upper end of the raft; frbmthe lake to the river, through bayou Daichet. is called nine miles: there is always in this bayou sufficient water for any boat to pass; from thence, upwards. Red river is free of all obstructions to the mountains. By lake Bistino and these two bayous an island is formed, about seventy miles long, and three or four wide, capable of affording settlements inferior to none on the river. From the above account you will perceive, that the only difficulty in opening a boat passage by this raft, through the lake, which is much shorter than by the course of the river, and avoid the current, and, indeed, was the river unobstructed, would always be preferred, is this small jam of timber at the point, just below the bayou Channo, as it is called. After the receipt of your letter, I had an opportunity of seeing some of the inhabitants who live near this place, who informed me that that small raft was easily broken, and that thev had lately been talking of doing it. I persuaded them to make tne attempt, and they accordingly appointed the Friday following, and all the neighbors were to be invited to attend and assist.. They met accordingly, and effected a passage next to one bank oi the river,-so that boats could pass; but-did not entirely break it; they intend to take another spell at it, when the water falls a little, and speak confidently of succeeding. _ 'The country about the head of lake Bistino is highly spoken of, as well the high lands as the river bottom. There are falling into the river, and lake in the vicinity, some handsome streams, of clear wholesome water, from towards Washita, one in particular, called bayou Badkah by the Indians, which is boatable at some seasons; this bayou passes through a long, narrow, and rich prairie, on which, my informant says, five hundred families might be desirably settled. And from thence up to where the Caddoes lately lived, the river banks are high, bottoms wide and rich as any other part of the river; from thence, it is much the same to the mouth of the Little river at the left. This river is generally from fifty to a hundred yards wide, heads in the great prairies south of Red river, and interlocks with the head branches of the Sabine and Trinity rivers, and in times of high water is boatable forty or fifty leagues, affording a large body of excellent, well timbered, and rich land; the low grounds from three to six miles wide. But the quality of the water, though clear, is very inferior to that of the streams that fall into Red river on the north side. The general course of Red river from this upwards is nearly from west to east, till we arrive at the Panis towns, when it turns northwestwardly. After leaving the mouth of the little river of the left, both banks are covered with strong thick cane, for about twenty miles; the low grounds very wide, rich, and do not overflow; the river widening in proportion as the banks are less liable to overflow; you arrive at a handsome rich prairie, twenty-five miles long, on the right side, and four or five miles wide, bounded by handsome oak and hickory woods, mixed with some short leaved pine, interspersed with pleasant streams and fountains of water. The opposite, or leftside, is a continuation of thick cane; the river, or low lands, ten or twelve miles wide. After leavingthe prairie,-the cane continues for about forty miles; you then arrive at another prairie, called Little Prairie, left side, about five miles in length, and from two to three in breadth; opposite side continues cane as before; low grounds wide, well timbered, very rich, and overflow but little: the river still widening. Back of the low grounds is a well timbered, rich, upland country, gently rolling, and well watered.' From the little prairie, both banks cane for ten or twelve miles, when the oak and pine woods come bluff to the river for about live miles: left hand side, cane as before, then the same on both sides, from ten to twenty miles wide, for about fifteen miles, when the cedar begins on both sides, and is the principal growth on the wide, rich river bottom, for forty miles. In all the world there is scarcely to be found a more beautiful growth of cedar timber: they, like the cedars of Libanus, are large, lofty, and straight. You now arrive at the mouth of the little river of the right. This river is about one hundred and fifty yards wide: the water clear as chrystal: the bottom of the river stony, and is boa table, at high water, up to the great prairies, near two hundred miles by the course of the river: the low grounds generally from ten to fifteen miles wide, abounding with the most luxuriant growth of rich timber, hut subject to partial inundation at particular rainy seasons. After leaving this river, both banks of Red river are cane, as before, for about twenty miles, when you come to the round prairie, right side, about five miles in circumference. At Ibis place. Red river is fordable at low water; a hard stony bottom, and is the first place from its mouth where it can he forded. This round prairie is high and pleasant, surrounded by handsome oak and hickory uplands; left side, cane as before, and then the same both sides for twenty miles, to the long prairie, left side, forty miles long; opposite, cane as before. Near the middle of this prairie, there is a lake of about five miles in circumference, in an oval form, neither tree or shrub near it, nor stream of water running either in or out of it ; it is very deep, and the water so limpid that a fish may he seen fifteen feet from the surface. By the side of this lake the Caddoques have lived from time immemorial. About one mile from the lake i- the hill on which, they say, the Great Spirit placed one Caddo family, who were saved when, by a general deluge, all the world were drowned; from which family all the Indians have originated. To this little, natural eminence, all the Indian tribes, as well as the Caddoques, for a great distance, pay a devout and sacred homage. Here the French, for many years before Louisiana was ceded to Spain, had erected a small fort, kept some soldiers to guard a factory they had here established for the Indian trade, and several French families were settled in the vicinity, built a flour mill, and cultivated wheat successfully for several years; and it is only a few years ago that the mill irons and mill stones were brought down. It is about twenty-five years since those French families moved down, and fourteen years since the Caddoques left it. Here is another fording place when the river is low. . On the opposite side, a point of high oak, hickory, and pine land comes bluff to the river for about a mile; after which, thick cane to the upper end of the prairie; then the same on both sides for about twelve miles: then prairie on the left side for twenty miles; opposite side cane; then the same for thirty miles; then an oak high bluffthree miles; cane again for about the same distance on both sides; then, for about one league, left side, is a beautiful grove of pecans, intermixed with no other growth; after which cane both sides for forty miles; then prairie;left side, tor twenty miles, and from one to two miles only in breadth; about the middleof which comes in a bayou of clear running water about fifty feet wide; then cane again both sides of the river for about forty miles: tiien, on the right side, a point of high pine woods, bluff to the river for about half a mile; cane again fifteen or sixteen miles? then a bluff of large white rocks for about half a mile, near a hundred feet high; cane again about forty-five miles, to a prairie on the right side, of about thirty miles long, and twelve or fifteen miles wide: there is a thin skirt of wood along the bank of the river, that, when the leaves are on the trees, the prairie is, from the river, scarcely to be seen. From the upperend of this prairie, it is thick cane for about six mile*, when we arrive at the mouth of Bayou Galle, which is on the right side, about thirty yards wide, a beautiful, clear, running stream of wholesome well-tasted water; after passing which, it is thick cane again for twenty-five miles, when we arrive at a river that falls in on the right side, which is called by the Indians Kiomitchic, and by the French La liiviere la Mine, or Mine river, which is about one hundred and fifty yards wide, the water clear and good, and is heatable about sixty miles to the silver mine, which is on the hank of the river, and the ore appears in large quantities, but the richness of it is not known. The Indians inform of their discovering another, about a year ago, on a creek that empties into the Kiomitchie, about three miles from its mouth, the ore of which, they say, resembles the other. The bottom land of this river is not wide, but rich; the adjoining high lands are rich, well timbered, well watered and situated. About the mine the current of the river is too strong for boats to ascend it, the country being hilly. After passing the Kiomitchie, both banks of the river are covered with thick cane for twenty-five miles, then, left side, a high pine bluff appears again to the river for about half a mile; after which nothing but cane again on each side for about forty miles, which brings you to the mouth of a handsome bayou, leftside, called by the Indians Nuhauclia, which, in English, means the Kick; the French call it Hois tP.tfre, or Bow-wood creek, from the large quantity of that wood that grows upon it. On this bayou, trappers have been more successful in catching beaver than on any other watC of Red river; it communicates with a lake, three or four miles from its mouth, called Swan lake, from the great number of swans that frequent it. It is believed that this bayou is boatable, at high water, for twenty or thirty leagues, from what I have been informed by some hunters with whom I have conversed, who have been upon it. The low grounds are from three to six miles wide, very rich; the principal growth on it is the hois d’arc. The great prairies approach pretty near the low grounds on each side of this creek; leaving which it is cane both sides for about eight miles, when we arrive at the month of the Vazzurcs, or Boggy river, which is about, two hundred yards wide, soft miry bottom, tbe water whitish, but well tasted/ Attempts have been made to ascend it in pirogues, but it was found to be obstructed by a raft of logs, about twenty miles up it. The current was found to be gentle, ami depth of water sufficient; was the channel not obstructed. might be ascended far up it. The low grounds on this river are not as wide as on most of the rivers that fall into Red river, but very rich; the high lands are a strong clay soil; the principal growth oak. After leaving this river the banks of Red river are alternately cane and prairie; timber is very small and scattered along only in places; it is now only to be seen along the water courses. From the Boggy river to the Blue river is about fifty miles, which comes in on the right side. The water of this river is called blue, from its extreme transparency; it is said to he well tasted, and admired, for its quality, to drink. The bed ol this river is lined generally with black and greyish flint stones; it is about fifty yards wide, and represented as a beautiful stream; pirogues ascend it about sixty or seventy miles. The low grounds of Blue river are a good width for plantations, very rich; the growth pecan, and every species of walnut. The whole country here, except on the margin of the water courses, is one immense prairie. * After passing this river, copses of wood only are to he seen here and there along the river bank lor about twenty-five miles, to a small turgid river, called by the Indians Bahachaha, and by the French Fuuxoachcta; some call it the Missouri branch of Red river; it emits a considerable quantity of water; runs from north to south, and falls into Red river, nearly at right angles, and heads near the head of the Arkansas, and is so brackish it cannot be drank. On this river, and on a branch of the Arkansas, not far from it. the Indians find the salt rock; pieces of it have often been brought to Natchitoches by hunters, who procured it from the Indians. From the mouth of this river, through the prairie, to the main branch of the Arkansas, is three days journey, perhaps sixty or seventy miles in a straight line; from this to the Panis or Towiache towns, by land, is about thirty miles, and by water, double the distance; the river is near a mile wide. The country on each side, for many hundreds of miles, is all prairie, except a skirt of wood along the river bank, and on the small streams; what trees there are, are small; the grass is green, summer and winter. In between thirty-three and thirty-four degrees of north latitude, the soil is very rich, producing luxuriantly every thing that is planted in it. The river from this upwards, for one hundred and fifty miles, continues at least a mile wide, and may he ascended in pirogues. Mr. Grappe, to whom I am indebted for the foregoing accurate description of Red river, informed me, that his personal knowledge of it did not extend but little above the Panis towns; but Mr. Breve), of the Isle Brevel, who was born at the Caddo old towns, where he was. had been further up it; and that whatever account he gave me, might be relied on. I therefore sought an opportunity, a few days after, to obtain Ironi Mr. Brevel the following narrative, which I wrote down from his own mouth as lie related it: “About forty years ago, I sat ofi'ou foot, from the Panis nation (who then lived about fifty leagues above where they now live) in company with a party of young Indian men, with whom I had been partly raised, on a hunting voyage, and to procure horses. We kept up on the south side ol Red river, as near it as we cou!d_ conveniently cross the small streams that fell in, sometimes at some distance, and at others very near it, in sight ol it We found the country all prairie, except small copses of wood, cedar, cotton or mu&keto, amongst which, a stick six inches in diameter, could not be found; the surface becoming more and more light, sandy, and hilly, with ledges of clifts of a greyish sandy rock, but every where covered with herbage. We found many small streams falling into the river, but none of any considerable size, or that discharged much water in dry seasons, but many deep gulleys formed by the rain water. After travelling for several days overa country of this description, the country became more broken, the hills rising into mountains, amongst which, we saw a great deal of rock salt, and an ore, the Indians said was my (meaning the white people’s) treasure; which I afterwards learnt was silver; and that amongst these mountains oi mines, we often heard a noise like the explosion of cannon, or distant thunder, which the Indians said was the. spirit of the. white people, working in their treasure; which I afterwards was informed, was the blowing of the mines, as it is called, which is common in all parts of Spanish America where mines exist. The main branch of the river becoming smaller, till it divided into large innumerable streams, that issued out of the valleys amongst these mountains; the soil very light and sandy, of a reddish grey color. We travelled on from the top of one mountain to the top of another, in hopes the one we were ascending was always the last, till the small streams we met with ran the contrary way, towards the setting sun, and the lands declined that way. We continued on till the streams enlarged into a river of considerable size, and the country became level, well timbered, the soil rich black loam; the waters were all clear and well tasted. Here we found a great many different tribes of the Ilietan, Apaches, and Concee Indians; we likewise fell in with them frequently, from the time we had been a few days out from the Panis towns, and were always treated kindly by them. “ 1 believe the distance from the Panis towns to where we saw the last, of Red river, is at least a hundred leagues; and that in crossing over the ridge, we saw no animals that were not common in all the interior of Louisiana, except the spotted tiger, and a few' white bears. After spending some days on the Western waters, we set off for the settlements of Santa Fe; steering nearly a southeast course, and in a few days, were out of the timbered country into prairie; the country became broken and hilly; the waters all running westwardly; the country clothed with a very luxuriant herbage, and frequently passing mines of silver ore. We arrived, at length, at a small meanly built town, in the Santa Fe settlement, containing about one hundred houses, round which were some small cultivated fields, fenced round with small cedars, and musketo brush wattled in stakes; this little town was on a small stream ot water that ran westwardly, that in a dry season did scarcely run at all; and that the inhabitants were obliged to water their cattle from wells; and I understand, that the Bayou upon which this town is situated, was no part of Rio Grande, but fell into the Western ocean; but of that I might have been mistaken. I understood that similar small towns or^missions were within certain distances of each other, for a great extent southwardly, towards Mexico, and that'the inhabitants were mostly christianised Indians and Maitiffs; that the mines in that settlement afforded very rich ore, which was taken away in large quantities, packed on mules, and had the same appearance of what we met with, about the head branches of Red river. After furnishing ourselves with horses at this place, we sat off again for the Panis towns, from whence we started; steering at first southwardly, in order to avoid a high mountainous country that is difficult to cross, that lies between Santa Fe and Red river; after travelling some distance soutli, we turned our course again northeastwardly, and arrived at the Panis towns in eighteen days from the. day we left Santa Fe settlements, and in three months and twenty days from the time we started.” He is of the opinion that, from the Panis tow'iis to SantaFe, in a right line, is nearly three hundredriniles; and all the country prairie, a few scattering cedar knobs excepted. After he had finished his narrative, I asked him how far Red river wras beatable. He said, not much above the Panis old towns; not that he knew of any particular falls or obstructions, but that the head branches of the river came from steep mountains, on w hich the rain often poured down in torrents, and runs into the river with such velocity, sweeping along with it large quantities of loose earth, of which these hills and mountains are composed, that it rolls like a swell in the sea, and would either sink or carry along with it, any boat that it might meet in the river. But, he observed at the same time, that his opinion was founded on no experiment that he had ever known made. I asked him, if the Indians had no pirogues high up in the river. He told me, that the Indians there knew' nothing of the use of them; for instead of their being, tor hundreds of miles, a tree large enough for a canoe, one could scarcely he found large enough to make a fowl trough. 1 asked him what animals were found in the great prairies. He told me, that from Blue river, upwards, oil both sides of Red river, there were innumerable quantifies of wild horses, buffalo, bears, wolves, elk, deer, foxes, sau-gliers or wild hogs, antelope, w hite hares,'rabbits, &c. and on the mountains, the spotted tiger, panther, and wild S'cat. He farther told me, that, about twenty-three years ago, he was employed by ihe Governor of St. Antoine, to go from that place into some of the Indian nations who lived towards Santa Fe, who were at war with the Spaniards, to try to make a peace with them, and bring in some of the chiefs to St. Antoine. He sat off from that place with a party of soldiers, and was to have gone to Santa Fe; they passed on a northwestwardly course for about two hundred miles.- but after getting into the great prairie, being a dry season, they were forced to turn back, for want of water for themselves and horses, and that he does not know how near he went to Santa Fe, but believes he might have been half way. together, that blacken the whole surface of the earth, and continue passing, without intermission, for weeks together, so that the whole surface of the country is, for many miles in breadth, trodden like a large road.

Observations made in a voyage, commencing at St. Catherine's landing, on the east bank of the Mississippi, proceeding downwards to the mouth of the Red liver': and from’ thence, ascending that river, the Black river, and the Washita river, as high as the Hot Springs, in the proximity of the last mentioned river. Extracted from the journals of William Dunbar, Esquire, and Doctor Hunter. Mr. Dunbar. Dr. Hunter, and the party employed by the United .States, to make a survey of. and explore, the country traversed by the Washita river, left St. Catherine's Landing, on the Mississippi, in latitude 31° 26' 30". north, and longitude 6li. 5' 56", west, from the meridian of Greenwich, on Tuesday, the 16th of October, 1804. A little distance below St. Catherine's creek, and five leagues from Natchez, they passed the "White cliffs, composed chiefly of white sand, surmounted by pine, and from one hundred to two hundred feet high. When the waters of the Mississippi are low, the base of the cliff is uncovered; which consists of different colored clays, and soniebeds of ochre, over which there lies, in places, a thin lamina of iron ore. Small springs, possessing a petrifying quality, flow over the clay and ochre; and numerous logs and pieces of timber, converted into stone, are strewed about the beach. Fine pure argil, of various colors, chiefly white and red. is found here. On the 17th, they arrived at the mouth of Red river, the confluence of which, with the Mississippi, agreeably to the observations made by M. tie Ferrer, lies in latitude 31° 1' 15", north, and longitude 6h. 7' II", west of Greenwich. Red river is here about five hundred yards wide, and without any sensible current. The banks of the river are clothed with willow; the land low. and subject to inundation, to' the height of thirty feet, or more, above the level of the water at this time. The month of the Red river is accounted to be seventy five leagues from New Orleans, and three miles higher up than the Chafalayas or Opelousas river, which was probably a continuation of the Red river when its waters did not unite with those of the Mississippi but during the inundation. On the’18th, the survey of the Red river was commenced, and, on the evening of the 19th, the party arrived at the month of the Black river, in latitude 31° 15' 48", north, and about twenty-six miles from the Mississippi. The Red river derives its name from the rich fat earth, or marl of that color, borne down by the floods; the last of which appeared to have deposited on the high bank a stratum, upwards of half an inch in thickness. The vegetation on its banks is surprisingly luxuriant, no doubt owing to the deposition of marl, during its annual floods. The willows grow to a good size: but other forest frees are much smaller than those seen on the banks of the Mississippi. As you advance up the river, it gradually narrows; in latitude 31° S', north, it is about two hundred yards wide, which width is continued to the mouth of Black river; where, each of them appears one hundred and fifty yards across. The banks of the river are covered w ith pea vine, and several sorts of grass bearing seed, which geese and ducks eat very greedily; and there are generally seen willows growing on one side, and, on the other, a small growth of black oak, packawn, hickory, elm, &c. The current in the Red river is so moderate, as scarcely to afford an impediment to its ascent. On sounding the Black river, a little above its mouth, there was found twenty feet of water, w ith a bottom of black sand. The water of Black river is rather clearer than that of the Ohio, and of a warm temperature, which it may receive from the water flowing into it from the valley of the Mississippi, particularly by the Catahoola. At noun, on the 23d, by a good meridian observation, they ascertained their latitude to be 30° 36' 29", north, and were then a little below the mouths of the Catahoola. Washita, and Bayou Tensa, the united waters of which form the Mack river. The current is very gentle the whole length of the Black river, which, in many places, does not exceed eighty yards in width. The banks on the lower part of the river present a great luxuriance of vegetation and rank grass, with red and black oak. ash, packawn, hickory, and some elms.* The soil is black marl, mixed with a moderate proportion of sand, resembling much the soil on the Mississippi banks; yet, the forest trees are not lofty, like to those on the margin of the Great river, but resembling the grow th on the Red river. In latitude 31° 22' 46", north, they observed that canes grew on several parts of the right bank; a proof that the-land is not deeply overflowed; perhaps from one to three feet. The banks have the appearance of stability, very little willow, or other productions of a newly formed soil, being seen on either side. On advancing up the river, the timber becomes larger, some places rising to the height of forty feet; yet. the land is liable to be inundated, not from the waters of this small river, but from the intrusion of its more powerful neighbor, the Mississippi. The lands decline rapidly, as in all alluvial countries, from the margin to the Cypress swamps, where more or less water stagnates all the year round. On the 21st. they passed a small, but elevated island, said to be the only one on this river, for more than one hundred leagues ascending. On the left bank, near this island, a small settlement, of a couple of acres, has been begun by a man and his wife. The banks are not less than forty feet above the present level of the water in the river, and are but rarely overflowed: on both sides they are clothed with rich cane-brake, pierced by creeks, lit to carry boats during the inundation. * Among- die plants growing- on the margin of the river, is the China root, used in medicine, and the cantac, occasionally used by the hunters for food; the last has a bulbous root, ten limes the size of a man’s fist. In preparing it, they first wash it clean from earth, then pound it well, and add water to the mass, and stir it up; after a moment’s settlement, the water and fecula is poured off. This operation is repeated till it yields no more fecula, the fibrous part only being left, which is thrown away as useless. The water is then poured from the sediment, which is dried in the sun, and will keep a long time. It is reduced into powder, and mixed with Indian meal or flour, and makes wholesome and agreeable food. The labor is performed by the women whilst they are keeping the camp, and their husbands are in the woods hunting. They saw many cormorants, and the hooping crane; geese and ducks are' not yet abundant, hut are said to arrive in myriads with the mins, and winter’s cold. They shot a fowl of the duck kind, whose web-foot was partially divided, and the body covered with a bluish or teadcolored plumage. On the morning of the 22d, they observed green matter floating on the river, supposed to come from the Catahoola, and other lakes and bayous of stagnant water, which, when raised a' little by rain, flow into the Black river: and, also, many patches of an aquatic plant, resembling smalj islands; some floating on the surface, and others adhering to,-or resting on, the shore and logs. On examining this plant, it was found to have a hollow jointed stem, with roots of the same form, extremely light, with very narrow willow-shaped leaves projecting from.the joint,- embracing, however, the whole of the tube, and extending to the next inferior joint or knot: the extremity of each branch is terminated by a spike of very slender narrow seminal [eaves, from one to two inches in length, and one-tenth, or less, in breadth, producing its seed on the underside of the. leaf, in a double row, almost in contract; the grains alternately placed in perfect regularity. Not being able to find the flower, its class and order could not be determined, although it is not probably new. Towards the upper part of the Black river, the shore abounded with muscles and penwmcles. The muscles were of the kind called pearl muscles: the men dressed and ate a quantity of them, considering them as an agreeable food; but Mr. D. found them tough and unpalatable. On arriving at the mouth of the Catahoola, they landed to procure information from a Frenchman settled there. Having a grant from the Spanish Government, he has made a small settlement, and keeps a ferry-boat, for carrying over men and horses, travelling to or from Natchez., and the settlements on Red river, and on the Washita river. The country here, is all alluvial. In process of time, the rivers shutting up ancient passages, and elevating the banks over which their waters pass, no longer communicate with the same facility as formerly; the consequence is, that many large tracts, formerly subject to inundation, are now entirely exempt from that inconvenience. Such is the situation of a most valuable tract upon, which this Frenchman is settled; his house stands on an Indian mount, with several others in view; there is, also, a species of rampart, surrounding this place, and one very elevated mount, a view and description of which is postponed till the return, their present situation not allowing of the requisite delay. The soil is equal to the best Mississippi bottoms; there is an embankment running from the Catahoola to Black river, (enclosing about 200 acres of rich land) at present about 10 feet high, and 50 feet broad; this surrounds four large mounds of earthy at the distance of a bow snot from each other; each of which may be 20 feet high, 100 feet broad, and 300 feet long on the top; besides a stupendous turret, situate on the back: part of the whole, or farthest from the water, whose base covers about an acre ol ground, rising by two steps or stories tapering in the descent; the whole surmounted by a great cane, with its top cut oil'. This tower of earth, on a measurement, was found to be 80 feet perpendicular. ■ ■ They obtained from the French settler, the following list of distances between post on the Washita, called fort Miro: From the mouth of Red river to the mouth of Black river, To the mouth of the Catahoola, 'Washita, and Ten/.a, To the river Ha-ha, on the right - - - - To the Prarie de Villemont, on the same side, To the Bayou Louis, on the same; rapids here. To Bayou Bumf, on the same side - - - . To the Prairie Noyu, (drown’d Savanna) - . To Pine Point, on the left, - - To Bayou Calumet, - - To the Coal-mine on the right, and Gypsum on opposite shore, To the first settlement,   - - To fort Miro, ’ - - mouth of Red river an to leagues. .22 1 ct 5 u 1 4 u 3 a 4^ u 3l u 3 ((12 i » 22 a Leagues, 91 From this place, they proceeded to the mouth of the Washita, in latitude 35° 37' 7" N. and encamped on the evening of the 23d. . This river derives its appellation from the name of an Indian tribe, formerly resident on its banks; the remnant of which, it is said, went into the great plains to the Westward, and either compose a small tribe themselves, or are incorporated into another nation. The Black river loses its name at the junction of the Washita, Catahoola, and Tensa, although our maps represent it as taking place of the Washita. The Tensa and Catahoola are also named from Indian tribes, now extinct; the latter is a creek twelve leagues long, which is the issue of a lake of the same name, eight leagues in length, and about two leagues in breadth, lilies West, from the mouth of the Catahoola, and communicates with the Red river during the great annual inundation. At the’ west or northwest angle of the lake, a creek called Little river enters, which preserves a channel with running water at all seasons, meandering along the bed of the lake; but in all other parts, its superficies, during the dry season, from Julyjjto November, and often later, is completely drained, and becomes covered with the most luxuriant herbage; the bed of the lake then becomes the residence of immense herds of deer, of turkeys, geese, crane, &c. which feed upon the grass and grain. Bayou Tensa serves only to drain oft'a part of the waters of the inundation from, the low lands of the Mississippi, which here communicate with the Black river during the season of high water. Between the mouth of the Washita, and Yillemont’s prairie on the right, the current of the river is gentle, and the banks favorable for towing. The lands, on both sides, have the appearance of being above the inundation; the timber generally such as high lands produce, being chiefly red, white, and black oaks, interspersed with a variety of other trees. The magnolia grandiflora, that infallible sign of the land not being subject to inundation, is not however among them. Along the banks, a stratum of solid clay, or marl, is observable, apparently of an ancient deposition; itlies in oblique positions, making an angle of nearly thirty degrees with the horizon, and generally inclined with the.descent of the river, although, in a few cases, the position was contrary; timber is seen projecting from under the solid bank, which seems indurated, and unquestionably very ancient, presenting a very different appearance’ from recently formed soil. The river is about eighty yards wide. A league above the mouth of the Washita, the Bayou Ha-ha, comes in unexpectedly from the right, and is one of the many passages through which the waters of the great inundation penetrate, and pervade all the low countries, annihilating, for. a time, the currents of the lesser rivers in the neighborhood of the Mississippi. The vegetation is remarkably vigorous along the alluvial banks, which are covered with a thick shrubbery, and innumerable plants, in full blossom at this late season. Villemont’s prairie is so named, in consequence of its being included within a grant under the French Government, to a gentlemen of that name. Many other parts on the Washita are named after their early proprietors. The French people projected and bega.ii extensive settlements on this river; but the general massacre planned, and in part executed, by the Indians, against them, and the consequent destruction of the Natchez tribe by the French, broke up all these undertakings, and they were not re-commenced under that Government. Those prairies are plains or savannas, without timber, generally very fertile, and producing an exuberance of strong, thick, and coarse herbage. When a piece of ground has once got into this state, in an Indian country, it can have no opportunity of re-producing timber; it being an invariable practice to set fire to the dry grass in the fall or winter, to obtain the advantage ot attracting game, when the young tender.grass begins to spring; this destroys the young timber, and the prairie annually gains upon the woodland. It, is probable that the immense plains, known to exist in America, may owe their origin to this custom. The plains of the Washita lie chiefly on the east side; and being generally formed like the Mississippi lands, sloping from the bank of the river to the great river, they are more or less subject to inundation in the rear, and in certain great floods, the water has advanced so far, as to be ready to pour over the margin into the Washita; this has now become a very rare thing, and it may be estimated that, from a quarter of a mile, to a mile in depth, will remain free from inundation during high floods. This is pretty much the case with those lands. nearly as high as the post of the Washita, with the exception of certain ridges of primitive high land: the rest being evidently alluvial, although not now subject to be inundated by the Washita river, in consequence of the great depth which the bed of the river lias acquired by abrasion. On approaching towards the bayou Louis, which empties its waters into the Washita on the right, a little below the rapids, there is a great deal of high land on both sides, which produces pine and other timber, not the growth of inundated lands. At the foot of the rapids, the navigation ot the river is impeded by beds ot gravel formed in it. The first rapids lie in latitude 31° 4s' 57.5" North, a little above which, there is a high ridge of primitive earth, studded with abundance of fragments of rock or stone, which appears to have been thrown up to the surface in a very irregular manner. The stone is of a friable nature, some of it having the appearance of indurated clay : the outside is blackish from exposure to the air: within, it is of a greyish white, it is said, that, in the hill, the strata are regular, and that good grindstones may be here obtained. The last of the rapids, which is formed by a ledge of rocks crossing the entire bed of the river, was passed in the evening of the 27th; above it, the water became again like a mill-pond, and about one hundred yards wide. The whole of these first shoals or rapids embraced an extent of a mile and a half: the obstruction was not continual, but felt at short intervals in this distance. On the right, about four leagues from the rapids, they passed the * bayou aux Bceufs,’ a little above a rocky hill; high land and savanna is seen on the right. On sounding the river, they found three fathoms water on a bottom of mud and sand. The banks of the river, above the bayou, seem to retain very little alluvial soil; the high land earth, which is a sandy loam of a light grey color, with streaks of red sand and clay, is seen on the left bank; the soil not rich, bearing pines, interspersed with red oak, hickory, and dogwood. The river is from sixty to one hundred yards wride here, but decreases as you advance. The next rapid is made by a ledge of rocks traversing the river, and narrowing the water channel to about thirty yards. The width between the high banks cannot be less than one hundred yards, and the banks from thirty to forty feet high. In latitude 32° 10'13" rapids and shoals again occurred, and the channel was very narrow: the sand bars at every point extended so far into the bend, as to leave little more than the breadth of the boat of water sufficiently deep for her passage; although it spreads over a w idth of seventy or eighty yards upon the shoal. In the afternoon of the 31st, they passed g little plantation, or settlement, on the right, and at night arrived at three others, adjoining each other. These settlements are on a plain, or prairie, the soil of which, we may be assured, is alluvial, from the regular slope which the land has from the river. The bed of the river is now sufficiently deep to free them from the inconvenience of its inundation; yet, in the rear, the waters of the Mississippi approach, and sometimes leave dry. but a narrow strip along the bank of the river. It is, however, now more common, that the extent of the fields cultivated (from a quarter to half a mile) remains dry during the season of the inundation. The soil is here very good, but not equal to the Mississippi bottoms; it may be esteemed second rate. At a small distance to the east are extensive cypress swamps, oyer which the waters of the inundation always stand, to the depth of from fifteen to twenty-five feet. On the west side, after passing over the valley of the river, whose breadth varies from a quarter of a mile to two miles, or more, the land assumes a considerable elevation, h orn one hundred to three hundred feet, and extends all along to the settlements of the Red river. These high lands are reported to be poor, and badly watered, being chiefly what is termed pine barren. There is here a ferry and road of communication between the post of the \\ ashita and the Natchez; and a fork of this road passes on to the settlement called the Rapids, on lied river, distant from this place, by computation, one hundred anil fifty miles. On this part of the river lies a considerable tract of land, granted by the Spanish Government to the Marquis of Maison Rouge, a French emigrant, who bequeathed it. with all his property, to Mr. Bouligny. son of the late Colonel of the Louisiana regiment, and by him sold to Daniel Clarke. It is said to extend from the post of the Washita, with a breadth of two leagues, including the river, down to the Bayou Calumet; the computed distance of which, along the river, is called thirty leagues, but supposed not more than twelve, in a direct line. On the 6th of November, in the afternoon, the party arrived at the post of the Washita, in lat. 32° 29' 37.25" north, where they were politely received by Lieut. Bowmar, who immediately ottered the hospitality of his dwelling, with all the services in his power. From.the ferry to this place, the navigation of the river is, at this season, interrupted by many shoals ami rapids. The general width is from eight to a hundred yards. The water is extremely agreeable to drink..and much clearer than that of the Ohio. In this respect it is very utdike its two neighbors, the Arkansas and Red rivers, whose waters are loaded with earthy matters ot a reddish-brown color, giving to them a chocolate-like appearance; and. when those rivers are low, their waters are not palatable, being brackish, from the great number of salt-springs which flow into them, and probably from the beds of rock-salt over which they may pass. The banks of the river presented very little appearance of alluvial land, but furnished an infinitude of beautiful landscapes, heightened by the vivid coloring they derive from the autumnal change of the leaf. Mr. Dunbar observes, that the change of color in the. leaves of vegetables, which is probably occasioned by the oxigen of the atmosphere acting on the vegetable matter, deprived of the protecting power of its vital principle, may serve as an excellent guide to the naturalist w ho directs his attention to the discovery of new objects for the use of the dyer. For, he has always remarked, that the leaves of those trees whose bark or wood is known to produce a dye, are changed in autumn to the same color which is extracted in the dyer's vat from the woods; more especially by the use of alum, or some other mordant, which yields oxigen: thus, the foliage of the hickory and oak. which produces the Quercitron bark, is changed, before its fall, into a beautiful yellow: other oaks assume a fawn color, a liver color, or a blood color, and are known to yield dyes of the same complexion. In about lat. 32° is' N. Dr. Hunter discovered, along the river side, a substance nearly resembling mineral coal: its appearance was that of the carbonated wood described by Kirwan. It does not easily burn; but. on being applied to the flame of a candle, it sensibly increased it, and Gelded a faint smell, resembling, in a slight degree, that of the gum lac of common sealing w ax. Soft friable stone is common, and great quantities of gravel and sand upon the beaches in this part of the river. A reddish clay appears in the strata, much indurated, and blackened by exposure to the light and air. The position called fort Miro, being the property of a private person, w ho was formerly civil commandant here, the lieutenant has taken post about four hundred yards lower; has built himself some log houses, and enclosed them within a slight stockade. Upon viewing the country east of the river, it is evidently alluvial; the surface has a gentle slope from the river to the rear of the plantations. The land is of excellent quality, being a rich black mould, to the depth of a foot, under which there is a friable loam of a brownish liver color. At the {tost of the Washita, they procured a boat of less draught of w ater than the one in w hich they ascended the river thus far. At noon, on the lltli of November, they proceeded on the voyage; and in the evening encamped at the plantation of Baron Bastrop. 'Fins small settlement on the Washita, and some of the creeks falling into it. contains not more than five hundred persons, of all ages anjl sexes. It is reported, however, that there is a great quantity of excellent land upon these creeks, and that the settlement is capable of extension, and may be expected, with an accession of population, to become very flourishing. There are three merchants settled at the post, who supply, at very exorbitant prices, the inhabitants with their necessaries; these, with the garrison, two small planters, anil a tradesman or two, constitute the present village. A great portion of the inhabitants continue the old practice of hunting, during the w inter season, and they exchange their peltry for necessaries with the merchants, at a low rate. During the summer, these people content themselves with raising corn, barely sufficient for bread during the year. In this manner they always remain extremely poor. Some few, who have conquered that habit of indolence, which is always the consequence of the Indian mode of life, and attend to agriculture, live more comfortably, and taste a little the sweets of civilized life. The lands along the river, above the post, are not very inviting, being a thin, poor soil, and covered with pine wood. To the right, the settlements on the Bayou Barthelemi, and Siard, are said to be on rich land. On the morning of the 13th. they passed an island, and a strong rapid, and arrived at a little settlement below a chain of rocks, which cross the channel between an island and the main land, called Roque-raw. The Spaniard, and 93 * !iis family, settled here, appear, from their indolence, to live miserably. The river acquires here a more spacious appearance, being about one hundred and fifty yards wide. In (he afternoon they passed the bayou Barthelemi, on the right, above the last settlements, and about twelve computed leagues from the post. Here commences Baron Bastrop’s great grant of land from the Spanish Government, being a square of twelve leagues to each side, a little exceeding a million of French acres. The banks of the river continue about thirty feet high; of which eighteen feet from the water are a clayey loam, of a pale ash color, upon which (he water has deposited twelve feet of light sandy soil, apparently fertile, and of a dark brown color. This description of land is of small breadth, not exceeding half a mile on each side of the' river, and may be called the valley of the Washita,beyond which there is high land, covered with pines. The soil, to the ‘Bayou des Buttes,’ continues thin, with a growth of small timber. This creek is named from a number of Indian mounds discovered by the hunters along its course. The margin of the river begins to be covered with such timber as usually grows on inundated land; particularly, a species of white oak, vulgarly called the overcup oak; its timber is remarkably hard, solid, ponderous, and durable; and it produces a large acorn in great abundance, upon which the bear feeds, and which is very fattening to hogs. In lat. 32° 50' 8" north, they passed a long and narrow island. The face of the country begins to change; the banks arc low and steep, the river deeper and more contracted, from thirty to fifty yards in width. The soil in the neighborhood of the river, is a very sandy loam, and covered by such vegetables as are found on the inundated lands of the Mississippi. The tract presents the appearance of a new soil, very different from what they passed below. This alluvial tract may be supposed the site of a great lake, drained by a natural canal formed by the abrasion of the waters; since which period, the annual inundations have deposited the superior soil; eiglrteen or twenty feet is yet wanting to render it habitable for man; it appears,-nevertheless, well stocked with the beasts of the forest, several of which were seen. Quantities of water fowl are beginning to make their appearance, which are not very numerous here until the cold rains and frost compel them to leave a more northern climate. Fish is not so abundant as might be expected; owing, it is said, to the inundation of the Mississippi, in the year 1799, which dammed up the Washita some distance above the Post, and produced a stagnation, and consequent corruption of the waters, that destroyed all the fish within its influence. At noon, on the fifteenth of November, they passed the island of Mallet, and at ninety yards northeast from the upper point of the island, by a good observation, ascertained their latitude to be 32° 59'27. 5" north, or two seconds and a half of latitude south of the dividing line between the territories of Orleans and Louisiana. The bed of the liver, along this alluvial country, is generally covered with water, and the navigation uninterrupted; but in the afternoon of this day, they passed three contiguous sand bars, or beaches, called “ Les Trois Battures;” and before evening, the “Bayou des Grande Marais,” or Great Marsh creek, on the right; and “La Cyprieri Chattelrau,” a point of high land on the same side, which reaches within half a mile of the river. As they advanced towards the Marais de Saline on the right, a stratum of dirty white colored clay, under the alluvial tract, showed them to be leaving the sunken, and approaching the high land country. The salt lick marsh does not derive its name from any brackishness in the water of the lake or marsh, but from its contiguity to some of the licks, sometimes termed “saline,’’and sometimes “glaise,” generally found in a clay, compact enough for potters’ ware. The Bayou dc la Tulipe, forms a communication between the lake and the river. Opposite to this place, there is a point of high land forming a promontory, advancing within a mile of the river, and to which boats resort when the low grounds are under water. A short league above, is the mouth of the Grand Bayou de la Saline, (Salt Lick creek.) This creek is of a considerable length, and navigable for small boats. The hunters ascend it, to a distance of one hundred of their leagues, in pursuit of game; and all agree that none of the springs which feed this creek are salt. It has obtained its name from the many buffalo salt licks which have been discovered in its vicinity. Although most of these licks, by digging, furnish water which holds marine salt in solution, there exists no reason for believing that many of them would produce nitre. Notwithstanding this low and alluvial tract appears in all respects well adapted to the growth of the long moss, (tilandsia). none was observed since entering it in lat. 32° 52'; and .as the pilot informed them none would be seen in their progress up the river, it is probable that the latitude of thirty-three degrees is about the northern limit of its vegetation. The long-leaf pine, frequently the growth of rich and even inundated lands, was here observed in great abundance; the short-leaved, or pitch nine, on the contrary, is always found upon arid lands, and generally in sandy and lofty situations. This is the season when the poor settlers on the Washita turn out to make their annua! hunt. The deer is now fat, and the skins in perfection; the bear is now also in his best state, with regard to the quality of his fur, and the quantity of fat or oil he yields; as he has been feeding luxuriantly on the autumnal fruits of the forest. It is here well known, that he does hot confine himself, as some writers have supposed, to vegetable food; he is particularly fond of hog’s flesh; sheep and calves are frequently his prey; and no animal escapes him which comes within his power, and which he is able to conquer. He often destroys the fawn, when chance throws it in his way; he cannot, however, discover it by smelling, notwithstanding the excellence of his scent; for nature has, as if for its protection, denied the fawn the property of leaving any effluvium upon his track,a property so powerful in the old deer.* The bear, unlike most other beasts of prey, does not kill the animal he has seized upon, before he eats it; but, regardless of its struggles, cries, and lamentations, fastens upon,and, if the expression is allowable, devours it alive. 'Ine hunters count-much on their profits from the oil drawn from the bear’s fat; which, at New Orleans, is always of ready sale, and much esteemed for its wholesomeness in cooking, being preferred to butter or hog’s lard. It is found to keep longer than any other animal oil without becoming rancid; and boiling it from time to time, upon sweet bay leaves, restores its sweetness,or facilitates its conservation. In the afternoon of the 17th, they passed some sand beaches, and over a few rapids. They had cane-brakes on both sides of the river; the canes were small, but demonstrate that the water does not surmount the bank more than a few feet. The river begins to widen as they advance, the banks of the river show the high land soil, with a stratum of three or four feet of alluvion, deposited by the river upon it. This superstratum is greyish, and very sandy, with a small admixture of loam, indicative of the poverty of the mountains and uplands where the river rises. Near this, they passed through a new, and very narrow-channel, in which all the water of the river passes, except in time of freshes, when the interval forms an island. A little above this pass is a small clearing, called “Cache la Tulipe” (Tulip’s Hiding-place;) this is the name of a French hunter, who here concealed his property. It continues the practice, of both white and red hunters, to leave their skins, &c. often suspended to poles, or laid over a pole placed upon two forked posts, in sight of the river, until their return from hunting. These deposites are considered as sacred, and few examples exist of their being plundered. After passing the entrance of a bay, which, within, must form a great lake during the inundation, great numbers of the long-leat pine were observed; and the increased size of the canes along the river’s bank, denoted a better and more elevated soil. On the left, was a high hill, (300 feet) covered with lofty pine trees. The banks of the river present more the appearance of upland soil, the understratum being a pale, yellowish clay, and the alluvial soil of a dirty white, surmounted by a thin covering of a brown vegetable earth. The trees improve in appearance, growing to a considerable size and height, though yet inferior to those on the alluvial banks of the Mississippi. After passing (he ‘ Bayou de Hachis,’ on the left, points of high land, not subject to be overflowed, frequently touch the river, and the valley is said to be more than a league in breadth, on each side. On the left are pine hills, called ‘ Cote de Champignole.’ The river is not more than fifty or sixty yards wide. On the morning of the 20th, they passed a number of sand beaches, and some rapids, but found good depth of water between * It may not be generally known to naturalits, that between the hoofs of deer, &c. there is found a sac, with its mouth in. dining upwards, containing more or less of musk, and which, by escaping over the opening in proportion to the secretion, causes the foot to leave a scent on the ground wherever it passes. During the ruLting season, this musk is so abundant, particularly in old males, as to be smelt by the hunters at a considerable distance. them. A creek, called 4 Cliemin Couyert,’ which forms a deep ravine in the high lands, here enters the river. Almost immediately above this is a rapid, where the water in the river is confined to a channel of about forty yard' in width; above it, they had to quit the main channel, on account of the shallowness and rapidity of the water, and pass along a narrow channel of only sixty feet wide: without a guide, a stranger might take this passage for a creek. Notwithstanding the lateness of the season, and the northern latitude they were in, they this day met with an alligator. The banks of the river are covered with cane, or thick underbrush, frequently so interwoven with thorn-and briars as to be impenetrable. Birch, maple. Iiollj. and two kinds of wood to which names have not yet been given, except * water-side wood,* are here met with: as also, persimmons, and small black grapes. The margin of the river is fringed with a variety of plants and vines, among which are several species of convolvulus. On the left, they passed a hill and cliff, one hundred feet perpendicular, crowned with pines, and called 4 Cote de Finn, (Fin’s hill,) from which a chain of high land continues some distance. The cliff presents the appearance of an ash-colored clay. A little further, on the right, is the Bayou d’Acacia, (Locust creek.) The river varies here from eighty to an hundred yards in width, presenting frequent indications of iron along its banks, and some thin strata of iron ore; the ore is from half an inch to three inches in thickness. On the morning of the 22d of November, they arrived at the road of the Cadadoquis Indian nation, leading to the Arkansas nation. A little beyond this, is the ‘Ecore a Fabri, (Fabri’s cliffs.) from eighty to an hundred feet high; and a little distance above, a smaller cliff, called * le petit ecor a Fabri.’ (the little cliff of Fabri:) these cliff-. appear chiefly to be composed of ash-colored sand,-with a stratum of clay at the base, such as runs all along under the banks of this river. Above these cliffs are several rapids, the current is swifter, and denotes their ascent into a higher country. The water becomes very clear, and equal to any. in its very agreeable taste, and as a drinking water. In the river are immense beds of gravel and sand, over which the water passes with great velocity, in the season of its floods, carrying with it v ast quantities of drift w ood, which it piles up, in many places, to the height of twenty feet above the present surface, pointing out the difficulty and danger of navigation, in certain times of the flood; accidents, however, are rare with the canoes of the country. As the party ascended, they found the banks of the river less elevated, being only from nine to twelve feet, and are, probably, surmounted by the freshes, some feet. The river becomes more obstructed by rapids, and sand and gravel beaches.; among which, are found, fragments of stone, of all forms, and a variety of colors, some highly polished and rounded by friction. The banks of the river, in this upper country, suffer greatly by abrasion; one side, and sometimes both, being broken down by every flood. At a place on die left, called * Auges d’Arcfon,’ (Arclon’s troughs.) i- laminated iron ore. and a stratum of tenacious black sand, shining with minute chryslals. The breadth of the river is, here, about eighty yards; in some places, however, it is enlarged by islands, in others, contracted to eighty or a hundred feet. Rocks of a greyish color, and rather friable, arc here found in many places on the river. The banks rise into hills of free stone, of a very sharp and fine grit, fit for grindstones, the strata irregular, inclining from 20° to 30° down the river. On the bailies grow willows, of a different form from those found below and on the margin of the Mississippi; the last are very brittle; these, on the contrary, are extremely pliant, resembling the osier, of which they are, probably, a species. At noon, on the 21th, they arrived at the confluence of the lesser Missouri with the Washita; the former is a considerable branch, perhaps a fourth of the Washita, and comes in from the left hand. The hunters often ascend the little Missouri, but are not inclined to penetrate far up, because it reaches near the great plains, or prairies, upon the Red river, visited by the lesser Osage tribe of Indians, settled on the Arkansas; these last frequently carry war into the Cadadoquis tribe, settled on the Red river, about west-southwest from tins place, and, indeed, they are reported not to spare any nation or people. They are prevented from visiting the head waters of the Washita, by the steep hills in which they rise. These mountains are so difficult to travel over, that the savages, not having an object sufficiently desirable, never attempt to penetrate to this river, and it is supposed to be unknown to the nation. The Cadadoquis (or Cadaux. as the French pronounce the word,) may be considered as Spanish Indians: they boast, and it is said, with truth, that they never have imbrued their hands in the blood of a white man. It is said, that the stream of the Little Missouri, some distance from its mouth, flows over a bright, splendid bed of mineral, of a yellowish white color, (most probably martial pyrites) that, thirty years ago. several of the inhabitants, hunters, worked upon this mine, and sent a quantity of the ore to the government at New Orleans, and they were prohibited from working anymore. There is a great sameness in the appearance of the river banks; the islands are skirted with osier, and immediately within. on the bank, grows a range of birch trees, and some willows; the more elevated banks are covered with cane, among which grows the oak, maple, elm. sycamore, ash, hickory, dogwood, holly, iron wood, &c. From the pilot, they learned, that there is a body of excellent laud on the little Missouri, particularly on the creek called the Bayou a terre noire’, which falls into it. This land extends to Red river, and is connected with the great prairies which form the hunting grounds of the Cadaux nation, consisting of about two hundred warriors. They are warlike, but frequently unable to defend themselves against the tribe of Osages settled on the Arkansas river, who, passing round the mountains at. the head of the Washita, and along the prairies which separate them from the main chain on the west, where the waters of the Red and Arkansas rivers have their rise, pass into the Cadaux country, to rob and plunder them. The water in the river Washita rising, the party are enabled to pass the numerous rapids and shoals which they meet with in the upper country, some of which are difficult of ascent. The general height of the main banks of the river are from six to twelve feet above the level of the water; the land is better in quality, the canes, &c. shewing a more luxuriant vegetation; it is subject to inundation, and shews a brow n soil, mixed with sand. Near Cache Ma$on, (Mason's hiding place.) on the right, they stopped to examine a supposed coal mine. Doctor Hunter and the pilot set out for this purpose, and, at about a mile and a half northwest from the boat, in the bed of a creek called Coal Mine creek, they found a substance similar to what they had before met with under that name, though more advanced towards the state of perfect coal. At the bottom of the creek, in a place then dry. was found detached pieces, of from fifty to one hundred pounds weight, adjoining to which, lay wood, changing into the same substance. A stratum of this coal, six inches thick, lay on both sides of this little creek, over another of yellow-clay, anil covered by one foot of gravel; on the gravel is eight inches of yellow loam, which bears a few inches of vegetable mould. This stratum of coal is about three feet higher than the water in the creek, and appears, manifestly, to have been, at some period, the surface of the ground. The gravel and loam have been deposited, there since, by the waters. Some pieces of this coal were very black and solid, of an homogeneous appearance, much resembling pit coal, but of less specific gravity. It does not appear sufficiently impregnated with bitumen, but may be considered as vegetable matter in the progress of transmutation to coal. Below the ’Bayou de l'eau froide,’ which runs into the Washita from the right, the river is one hundred and seventy yards wide, flowing through tolerably good land; they passed a beautiful forest of pines, on the 2Sth, fell in with an old Dutch hunter and his party, consisting in all of five persons. This man has resided forty years on the Washita, and before that period has been up the Arkansas river, the White river, and the river St. Francis; the two last, he informed, are of difficult navigation, similar to the Washita; but the Arkansas river is of great magnitude, having a large and broad channel, and when the water is low, has great sandbanks, like to those in the Mississippi. So far as he has been up it, the navigation is safe and commodious, without impediment from rocks, shoals, or rapids; its bed being formed of mud and sand. The soil on it, is of the first rate quality. The country is easy of access, being lofty open forests, unembarassed by canes or other under grow th. The water is disagreeable to drink, being of a red color, and brackish w hen the river is low. A multitude of creeks, which flow into the Arkansas, furnish sweet water, which the voyager is obliged to carry with him for the supply of his immediate w’ants. This man confirms the accounts of silver being abundant up that river; he has nor been so high as to see it himself, but says he received a silver pin from a hunter, who assured him that he himself collected the virgin silver from the rock, out of which he made the epinglette. by hammering it out. The tribe of Osages live higher up than this position, but the hunters rarely go so high, being afraid of these savages, who are at war with all the world, and destroy all strangers they meet with. It is reported that the Arkansas nation, with a part of the Choctaws, Chickasaws, Shawanese, &c. have formed a league, and are actually gone, or going, eight hundred strong, against these depredators, with a view to destroy or drive them entirely off, and possess themselves of their fine prairies, which are most abundant hunting grounds, being plentifully stocked with buffalo, elk, deer, bear, and every other beast of the chase, common to those latitudes in America. This hunter having given information of a salt spring in their vicinity, from which he frequently supplied himself by evaporating the water, Dr. Hunter, with a party, accompanied him, on the morning of the 29th November, to the place; they found the saline about a mile and a half north of the camp from whence they set out, and near a creek which enters the Washita a little above. It is situated in the bottom of the bed of a dry gully. The surrounding land is rich, and well timbered, but subject to inundation, except an Indian mount on the creek side, having a base of eighty or a hundred feet diameter and twenty feet high. After digging about three feet, through blue clay, they came to a quicksand, from which the water flowed in abundance; its taste was salt and bitter, resembling that of water in the ocean. In a second hole, it required them to dig six feet before they reached the quicksand, in doing which, they threw up several broken pieces of Indian pottery. The specific gravity, compared with the river, was, from the first pit, or that three feet deep, 1.02720; from the second pit, or that six feet deep, 1.02104, yielding a saline mass, from the evaporation of ten quarts, which, when dry, weighed eight ounces; this brine is, therefore, about the same strength as that of the ocean on our coast, and twice the strength of the famous licks in Kentucky, called Bullet’s lick, and Mann’s lick, from which so much salt is made. The " Fourche des Cadaux” (Cadadoquis fork) which they passed on the morning of the 30th, is aboutone hundred yards wide at its entrance into the Washita from the left; immediately beyond which, on the same side, the land is high, probably elevated three hundred feet above the water. The shoals and rapids here impede their progress. At noon, they deduced their latitude by observation, to be 34° 11' 37" north. Receiving information of another saline or saltlick. Dr. Hunter landed with a party to view it. The pit was found in a low place, subject to be overflowed from the river; it was wet and muddy, the earth on the surface yellow, but on digging through about four feet of blue clay, the saltwater oozed from a quicksand; ten quarts of this water, produced, by evaporation, six ounces of a saline mass, which, from taste, was principally marine salt; to the taste, however, it showed an admixture of soda, and muriated magnesia; but the marine salt greatly predominated. The specific gravity was about 1.0176; probably weakened from the rain which had fallen the day before. The ascent of the river becomes more troublesome from the rapids and currents, particularly at the Isle du bayou des roches (Rocky creek island) where it required great exertions, and was attended with some hazard, to pass them. This island is three-fourths of a mile in length. .The river presents a series of shoals, rapids, and small cataracts; and they passed several points of high land, lull of rocks and stones, much harder and more solid than they had yet met with. The rocks were all silicious, with their fissures penetrated by sparry matter. Indications of iron were frequent, and fragments of poor ore were common, but no rich ore of that or any other metal was found. Some of the hills appear well adapted to the cultivation of the vine; the soil being a sandy loam, with a considerable portion of gravel, and a superficial covering of good vegetable black earth. The natural productions are, several varieties of oak, pine, dogwood, holly, &c. with a scattering undergrowth of whortleberry, hawthorn, china brier, and a variety of small vines. Above the Isle de Mallon, the country wears another aspect; high lands and rocks frequently approach the river. The rocks, in grain, resemble free stone,‘and are hard enough to' be used as hand-mill stones, to which purpose they are frequently applied. The quality of the land improves, the stratum of vegetable earth being from six to twelve inches, of a dark brown color, with an admixture of loam and sand. Below Deer island, they passed a stratum of free-stone, fifty feet thick, under which is a quarry of imperfect slate, in perpendicular layers. About a league from the river, and a little above the slate quarry, is a considerable plain, called “ Prairie de Champignole,” often frequented by buffalo; some salt licks are found near it, and in many situations, on both sides of this river, there are said to be salines which may hereafter be rendered very productive, and from which the future settlements may be abundantly supplied. About four miles below the “chutes” (falls) they, from a good observation, found the latitude 34° 29'25.5." The land on either hand continues to improve in quality, with a sufficient stratum of dark brown earth. Hills frequently rise out of the level country, full of rocks and stones, hard and flinty, and often resembling"turkey oil stones; of this kind was a promontory, which came in from the right hand a little below the chutes. At a distance, it presented the appearance of ruined buildings and fortifications; and several isolated masses of rock, conveyed the idea of redoubts and out-works. This effect was heightened by the rising of a flock of swans, which had taken their station in the water, at the foot of these walls. As the voyagers approached, the birds floated about majestically on the glassy surface of the water, and in tremulous accents seemed to consult upon means of safety. The whole was a sublime picture. In the afternoon of the 3d of December, they reached the chutes, and found the falls to be occasioned by a chain of rocks, of the same hard substance seen below, extending in the direction of northeast and southwest, quite across the river. The water passes through a number of breaches, worn by the impetuosity of the torrent, where it forms so many cascades. The chain of rock, or hill on the left, appears to have been cut down to its present level by the abrasion of the waters. By great exertions, and lightening the boat, they passed the chutes this evening, and encamped just above the cataracts, and within the hearing of their incessant roar. Immediately above the chutes, the current of the water is slow, to another ledge of hard free stone; the reach between is spacious, not less than two hundred yards wide, and terminated by a hill three hundred feet high, covered with beautiful pines. This is a fine situation for building. In lat. 34° 25' 48" they passed a very dangerous rapid, from the number of rocks which obstruct the passage of the water, and break it into foam. On the right of the rapid, is a high, rocky hill, covered with very handsome pine woods. The strata of the rock has an inclination of thirty degrees to the horizon, in the direction of the river, descending. This hill may b<5 three hundred, or three hundred and fifty feet high. A border, or list of green cane, skirts the margin of the river, beyond which, generally rises a high, and, sometimes, a barren hill. Near another rapid, they passed a hill on the left, containing a large body of blue slate. A small distance above the Bayou de saline, they had to pass a rapid of one hundred and fifty yards in length, and four feet and a half fall, which, from its velocity, the French hunters have denominated “ La Cascade.” Below the cascade, there are rocky hills on both sides, composed of very hard freestone. The stone in the bed of the river, and which had been rolled from the upper country, was of the hardest flint, or of a quality resembling the Turkey oil-stone. Fourche au Tigre, (Tiger’s creek) which comes in from the right, a little above the cascade, is said to have many extensive tracts of rich level land upon it. The rocky hills here frequently approach the Washita on both sides; rich bottoms are, nevertheless, unfrequent, and the upland is sometimes of moderate elevation, and tolerably level. The stones and rocks here met with, have their fissures filled by sparry and chrystaline matter. Wild turkeys become more abundant, and less difficult of approach, than below; and the howl of the wolves is heard during the night. To the Fourche of Calfat (Caulker’s creek) where the voyage terminates, they found level and good land on the right, and high hills on the left hand. After passing over a very precipitous rapid, seemingly divided into four steps or.falls, one of which was at least fifteen inches in perpendicular height, and which, together, could not be less than five and a half feet, they arrived at Ellis’s camp, a small distance below the Fourche au Calfat, where they stopped on the 6th of December, as the pilot considered it the most convenient landing, from whence to carry their necessary baggage to the hot springs: the distance being about three leagues. There is a creek, about two leagues higher up, called “ Bayou des sources chaudes,” (Hot Spring creek) upon the banks of which, the hot springs are situ- ted, at about two leagues from its mouth. The banks of it are hilly, and the road less eligible from Ellis’s camp. On ascending the hill, to encamp, they found the land very level and good; some plants in flower, and a great many ever-green vines; the forest oak, with an admixture of other woods. The latitude of this place is, 34° 27' 35.5" north. The ground on which they encamped, was about fifty feet above the water in the river, and supposed to be thirty feet higher than the inundation. Hills of considerable height, and clothed with pine, were in view; but the land around, and extending beyond their view, lies handsomely for cultivation. The superstratum is of a blackish brown color, upon a yellow basis, the whole intermixed with gravel and blue schistus, frequently so far decomposed as to have a strong alluminous taste. From their camp, on the Washita, to the hot springs, a distance of about nine miles, the first six miles of the road is in a westerly direction, with many sinuosities, and the remainder northerly: which courses are necessary, to avoid some very steep hills. In this distance, they found three principal salt licks, and some inferior ones, which are all frequented by buffalo, deer. &c. The soil around them, is a , white tenacious clay, probably fit for potters ware: hence the name of “glaise,” which the French hunters have bestowed upon most of the licks frequented by the beasts of the forest ; many of which exhibit no saline impregnation. The first two miles from the river camp, is over level land, of the second rate quality: the timber chiefly oak, intermixed with other trees, common to the climate, and a few scattering pines. Further on. the lands on either hand, rise into gently swelling hills, covered with handsome pine woods. The road passes along a valley, frequently wet by the numerous rills and springs of excellent water, which issue from the foot of the hills. Near the hot springs, „tlie hills become more elevated, steeper of ascent, and rocky. They are here called mountains, although none of them in view, exceed four or five hundred feet in altitude. It is said, that mountains of more than five times the elevation of these hills, are to be seen in the northwest, towards the sources of the Washita. One of them is called the Glass, Crystal, or Shining mountain, from the vast number of hexagonal prisms of very transparent and colorless chrystal, which are found on its surface: they arc generally surmounted by pyramids at one end, rarely on both. These chrystals do not produce a double refraction of the rays of light. Many searches have been made over these mountains for the precious metals, but, it is believed, without success. At the hot springs, they found an open log cabin anil a few huts of split boards, all calculated for summer encampment, and which had been erected by persons resorting to the springs lor the recovery of their health. They slightly repaired these lints, or cabins, for their accommodation during the time of their detention at the springs, for the purpose of examining them and the surrounding country, and making such astronomical observations as were necessary, for ascertaining their geographical position. It is understood, that the hot springs are included within a tract of some hundreds of acres, granted by the late Spanish commandant of Washita to some of his friends: but it is not believed that a regular patent was ever issued for the place, and it cannot be asserted, that residence, with improvement, here form a plea to claim the land upon. On their arrival, they immediately tasted the waters ot the hot springs: that is. after a few minutes cooling, for it was impossible to approach it with the lips when first taken up. without scalding. The taste does not differ from that of good water rendered hot by culinary fire. On the tenth they visited all the hot springs. They issue on the east side of the valley, where the huts are, except one spring, which rises on the west bank of the creek, from the sides and foot of a hill. From the small (juantity of calcareous matter vet deposited, the western spring does not appear to be of long standing: a natural conduit probably passes under tlic bed of the creek and supplies it. There are four principal springs rising immediately on the east bank of the creek, one of which may rather be saitl to spring out of the gravel bed of the run: a fifth, a smaller one, that above mentioned as rising on the west side of the creek : and a sixth of the same magnitude, the most northerly, and rising near the bank of the creek. These are ail the sources which merit the name ol springs, near to the huts; but there is a considerable one some distance below; and all along, at intervals, the warm water oozes out, or drips from the bank into the creek, as appears from the condensed vapour floating along the margin of the creek, where the drippings occur. The hill from which the lmt springs issue, is of a conical form, terminating at the fop with a few loose fragments of rock, covering a fiat space twenty-five feet in diameter. Although the figure of the hill is conical, it is not entirely isolated, but connected with the neighboring hills by a very narrow ridge. The primitive rock ot this hill, above the base, is principally silicious, some part of it being of the hardest flint; others, a freestone, extremely compact and solid, and of various colors. The base of the hill, and tor a considerable extent, is composed ot a blackish blue schistus. which divides into perpendicular lamina, like blue slate. The water of the hot springs is therefore delivered from the silicious rock, generally invisible at the. surface, from the mass of calcareous matter with which it is incrusted, or rather buried, and which is perpetually precipitating from the_water of ihe springs. A small proportion of iron, in the form of a red cola, is also deposited, the color of which is frequently distinguishable in the lime. In ascending the hill, several patches of rich black earth are found, which appear to be formed by the decomposition of the calcareous matter; in other situations the superficial earth is penetrated or incrusted by limestone, with fine lamina, or minute fragments of iron ore. The water of the hot springs must formerly have issued at a greater elevation in the hill, and run over the surface, having formed a mass of calcareous rock one hundred feet perpendicular, by its deposition. In this high situation they found a soring, whose temperature was 110° of Fahrenheit’s thermometer. After passing the calcareous region, they found the primitive bill covered by a forest of not very large trees, consisting chiefly of oak, pine, cedar, holly, hawthorn, and others common to the climate, with a great variety of vines, some said to produce black, and others green grapes, both excellent in their kinds. The soil is rocky, interspersed with gravel, sand, and fine vegetable mould. On reaching the height of two hundred feet perpendicular, a considerable change in the soil was observable: it was stony, and gravelly, with a superficial coat of black earth, but. immediately under it, lies a stratum of tat. tenacious, soapy, red clay, inclining to the color of bright Spanish snuff, homogeneous, with scarcely any admixture of sand, no saline, but rather a soft agreeable taste. The timber diminishes, and the rocks increase in size to the summit: the whole height is estimated at three hundred leet above the level of the valley. On examining the four principal springs, or those which yield the greatest quantity of water, or ol the highest temperature, No. l was found to raise the mercury to 150°, No. 2 to 151°. No. 3 to 130°, and No. 4 to 132° ol Fahrenheit's thermometer. The last is on the west side of the creek. No. 3 is a small basin, in which there is a considerable quantity of green matter, having much the appearance of a vegetable bod v._ being detached from the bottom, yet connected with it by something like a stem, which rests in calcareous matter. The body of one of these pseudo plants was from four to five inches in diameter, the bottom a smooth film of some tenacity, and the upper surface divided into ascending fibres of one-half or three-lburths of an inch long, resembling the gills of a fish, in transverse rows. A little further on was another small muddy basin, in which the water was warm to the finger; in it was a vennes. about hall an inch long, moving with a serpentine or vermicular motion. It was invariably observed, that the green matter forming on the stones and leaves, covered a stratum of calcareous earth, sometimes a little hard or brittle, at others, soft and imperfect. From the bottom of one of the hot springs, a frequent ebullition ot gas was observed, which, not having the means of collecting, they could not. ascertain its nature; it was not inflammable, and there is little doubt of its being carbonic acid, from the quantity of lime, and the iron held in solution by the water. They made the following rough estimate ol' the quantity of water delivered by the springs: There are four principal springs, two of inferior note, one rising out of the gravel, and a number of drippings and drainings, all issuing from the margin, or from under the rock which overhangs the creek. Of the four first mentioned, three deliver nearly equal quantities; but No. 1, the most considerable, delivers about five times as much as one ot the other three; the two of inferior note, may, together, be equal to one. and all the droppings, and small springs, are probably under-rated at double the quantity of one of the three; that is, all together, they will deliver a quantity equal to eleven times the water issuing from the one most cominodiously situated for measurement. This spring filled a vessel of eleven quarts in eleven seconds; hence, the whole quantity of hot water delivered lrom the springs at the base of the hill, is one hundred and sixty five gallons in a minute, or 3,771] hogsheads, in 24 hours; which is cquai to a handsome brook, and might work an overshot mill. In cool weather, condensed vapour is seen rising out of the gravel bed of the creek, from springs which cannot be taken into account. During the summer and fall, the creek receives little or no water but what is supplied by the hot springs. At that season the creek itself is a hot bath, too hot, indeed, near the springs; so that a person may choose the temperature most agreeable to himself, by selecting a natural basin nearer to, or farther from, the principal spring?. At three or four miles helow the springs, the water is tepid, and unpleasant to drink. From the Western mountain, estimated to be of equal height with that from which the hot springs flow, there are several fine prospects. The valley of the Washita, comprehended between the hills on either side, seemed a perfect flat, and about twelve miles wide. On all hands were seen the hills, or mountains, as they are here called, rising behind each other. In the direction of north, the most distant were estimated to be fifty miles off, and are supposed to be those of the Arkansas river, or the rugged mountains which divide the waters of the Arkansas from those of the Washita, and prevent the Osage Indians from visiting the Tatter, of which they are supposed to be ignorant; otherwise, their excursions here would prevent this place from being visited by white persons, or even Indians of other tribes. In a southwest direction, at about fifty miles distance, is seen a perfect level ridge, supposed to be the high prairies of the Red river. Notwithstanding the severity of the weather, a considerable number, and some variety of plants were in flower, and others retained their verdure: indeed, the ridge was more temperate than the valley below; there, it was cold, damp, and penetrating; here, dry, and the atmosphere mild. Of the plants growing here, was a species of cabbage'; the plants grow with expanded leaves spreading on the ground, of a deep green, with a shade of purple; the taste of the cabbage was plainly predominant, with an agreeable warmth, inclining to that of the radish; several tap roots penetrated with the soil, of a white color, having the taste of horse radish, but much milder. A quantity of them taken to the camp and dressed, proved palatable and mild. It is not probable that cabbage seed has been scattered on this ridge; the hunters ascending this river, have always had different, objects. Until further elucidation, this cabbage must be considered indigenous to this sequestered quarter, and may be denominated the cabbage radish of the Washita. They found a plant, then green, called by the French racine rouge” [red root) which is said to be a specific in female, obstructions; it has also been used, combined with the china-root, to dye red; the last, probably, as a mordant. The top of this ridge is covered with rocks ofa flinty kind, and so veiy hard, as to be improper for gun flints: for, when applied to that use, it soon digs cavities in the hammer of the lock. This hard stone is generally white, but frequently clouded with red, brown, black, and other colors. Here and there fragments of iron stone were met with; and where a tree had been overturned, its roots brought to view fragments of schistus, which were suffering decomposition from exposure to the atmosphere. On digging, where the slope of the hill was precipitous, they tound the second stratum to be a reddish clay, resembling that found_ on the conical^ hill, east of the camp. At two thirds down the hill, the rock was a hard free stone, intermixed with fragments of flint, which had probably rolled from above. Still lower was found a blue schistus, in a state tending to decomposition, where exposed to the atmosphere, but hard, and resembling coarse slate, in the interior. Many stones had the appearance of the turkey oil stone. At the foot of the hill, it expands into good farming land. Doctor Hunter, on examining the water of the hot springs, obtained the following results: It differed nothing from other hot water in smell or taste; but caused a slight eructation shortly after drinking it. Its specific gravity is equal to rain or distilled water. It gave to litmus paper, a slight degree of redness, evincing the presence of the carbonic acid, or fixed air. Sulphuric acid threw down a few detached particles. Oxylat of ammoniac caused a deposition and white cloud, shewing the presence ofa small portion of lime. Prussiat of potash produced a slight and scarcely perceptible tinge of blue, designating the presence of a small quantity of iron. Sixteen pounds of water, evaporated to dryness, left ten grains of grey powder, which proved to be lime. The myrtle wax tree grows in the. vicinity of-the springs. At the season in which the voyagers were there, the wax was no longer green, but had changed its color to a gfeyish white, from its long exposure to the weather. The berry, when examined by a microscope, is less than the smallest garden pea. approaching to an oval in form. The nucleus, or real seed, is the size of the seed of a radish, and is covered with a number of brownish kidney shaped glands, of a brown color, and sweet taste; these glands secrete the wax, which completely envelops them, and at this seasoiij gives to (he whole the appearance of an imperfectly white berry. This is a valuable plant, and merits attention: its favorite position is a dry soil, rather poor, and looking down upon the water. It is well adapted to ornayient the margins ot canals, lakes, or rivulets. The cassina yapon, is equally beautiful, and proper for the same purpose: it grows here along the banks of this stony creek, intermingled with the myrtle, and bears a beautiful little red berry, very much resembling the red currant. The rock through which the hot springs either pass or trickle over, appears undermined by the waters of the creek. The hot water is continually depositing calcareous, and, perhaps, some silicious matter; forming new rocks, always augmenting, and projecting their promontories over the running water of the creek, which prevents its formation below the surface. Wherever this calcareous crust is seen spreading over the bank and margin of the creek, there most certainly the hot water will be found; either running over the surface, or through sonic channel, perhaps below the new rock, or dripping from the edges of the overhanging precipice. The progress of nature, in the formation of this new rock, is curious, and worthy the attention of the mineralogist. When the hot water issues from the fountain, it frequently spreads over a superficies of some extent; so far as it reaches, on either hand, there is a deposition or growth of green matter: several lamina o( this green matter will be found lying over-each other; and immediately under, and in contact with the inferior lamina, which is not thicker than paper, is found a whitish substance, resembling a coagulum; when viewed with a microscope, this last is also found to consist of several, sometimes a good number of lamina, of which that next the green is the finest, and thinnest, being the last formed; those below increasing in thickness and tenacity, until the last terminates in a soft earthy matter, which reposes on the more solid rock. Each lamina of the coagulum is penetrated in all its parts by calcareous grain, extremely minute, and divided in the more recent web, but much larger, and occupying the whole of the inferior lamina. The under stratum is continually consolidating, and adding bulk and height to the rock; when this acquires such an elevation as to stop the passage of the water, it finds another course over the rock, hill, or margin of the creek; forming, in turn, accumulations of recent matter, over the whole of the adjacent space; when the water has found itself a new channel, the green matter, which sometimes acquires a thickness of half an inch, is speedily converted into a rich vegetable earth, and becomes the. food of plants. The surface of the calcareous rock also decomposes, and forms the richest black mould intimately mixed with a considerable portion of soil; plants and trees vegetate luxuriantly upon it. On examining a piece of ground upon which the snow dissolved as it fell, and which was covered with herbage, they found in some places a calcareous crust on the surface, but in general a depth of from five inches to a foot of the richest black mould. The surface was sensibly warm to the touch. In the air, the mercury in the thermometer stood at forty-four degrees; when placed four inches under the surface, and covered with earth, it rose rapidly to sixty eight degrees; and upon the calcareous rock, eight inches beneath the surface, it rose to eight)' degrees. This result was uniform over the whole surface, which was about a quarter of an acre. On searching, they found a spring about fifteen inches under the surface, in the water of which, the thermometer shewed a temperature of one hundred and thirty degrees. Beneath the black mould, was found a brown mixture of lime and silex, very loose and divisible; apparently in a state of decomposition, and progressing towards the formation ofblack mould; under this brownish mass, it became gradually whiter and harder, to the depth of from six to twelve inches, where it was a calcareous sparkling stone. It was evident, that the water had passed over this place, and formed a flat superficies of “ silicious lime .stone;” and that its position, nearly level, had- facilitated the accumulation of earth in proportion as the decomposition advanced. Similar spots of ground were found higher up the. hill, resembling little savannas, near which hot springs were always discovered, which had once flowed over them. It appears probable that the hot water of the springs, at an early period, had all issued from its grand reservoir in the hill at a much great-er elevation than at present. The calcareous crust may be traced up, in most'situations, on the west side of the hill, looking down the creek and valley, to a certain height, perhaps one hundred feet perpendicular. In this region the hill rises precipitously, and is studded with hard silicious stones: below, the descent is more gradual, and the. soil a calcareous black earth. It is easy to discriminate the primitive hill from that which has accumulated by precipitation from the water of the springs. This last is entirely confined to the west side .of the hill, and washed at its base by the waters of the creek, no hot spring being visible in any other part of its circumference. By actual measurement, along the 'base of the hill, the influence of the springs is found to extend seventy perches, in a direction a little to the eastward of north. Along the v\ hole of this place, the springs have deposited stony matter, calcareous, with an admixture of silex. or chrystalized lime. The accumulation of calcareous matter is more considerable at the north end of the hill than the south; the first may be above a hundred feet perpendicular, but sloping much more gradually than the primitive hill above, until it approaches the creek, where, not, unfrequently, it terminates in a precipice, of from six to twenty feet. The difference between the primitive and secondary hill is so striking, that a superficial observer must notice it. The first is regularly very steep, and studded with rock and stone of the hardest flint, and other silicious compounds; and a superficies of two or three inches of good mould covers a red clay. Below, on the secondary hill, wnieh carries evident marks of recent formation, no flint or silicious stone is found; the calcareous rock conceals all from view, and is itself frequently covered by much fine, rich, black earth. It would seem that this compound, precipitated from the hot waters, yields easily to the influence of the atmosphere: for, when the waters cease to flow over any portion of the. rock, it speedily decomposes: probably more rapidly from the heat communicated from the interior of the hill, as insulated masses of the rock are observed to remain without change. The cedar, the wax myrtle, and the cassina yapon, all evergreens, attach themselves particularly to the calcareous region, and seent to grow and thrive, even in the clefts of the solid rock. A spring, enjoying a freedom of position, proceeds with great regularity in depositing the matter it holds in solution. The border, or.rim, of its basin, forms an elevated ridge, from whence proceeds a glacis, all around. When the waters have flowed for some time over one parbof the brim, this becomes more elevated, and the water has to seek a passage where there is less resistance; thus forming, in miniature, a crater, resembling, in shape, the conical summit of a volcano. The hill being steep above, the progress of petrifaction is stopped, on that side, and the waters continue to flow and spread abroad, encrusting the whole face of the hill below. 'I'lie last formed calcareous border of the circular basin is soft, and easily divided. At a small depth.it is more compact; and, at the depth of five inches, it is generally hard white stone. If the bottom (if the basin is stirred up, a quantity of the red calx of iron rises, and escapes over the summit of the crater. Visitants to the hot springs, having observed shrubs and trees, with their roots, in the hot water, have been induced to try experiments, by sticking branches of trees in the run of hot water. Some branches of the wax myrtle were found thrust into the bottom of a spring run. the water of which was 130°, by Fahrenheit’s thermometer. The foliase and fruit of the branch were not only sound and healthy, but, at the surface of the water, roots were actually sprouting from it. On pulling it up, the part which had penetrated the hot mud, was found decayed. The green substance discoverable at the bottom of the hot springs, and which, at first sight, has the appearance of plush, on examination by the microscope, was found to be a vegetable production. A film of green matter spreads itself on the calcareous base, from which rise fibres more than half an inch in length, forming a beautiful vegetation. Before the microscope, it sparkled with innumerable nodules of lime, some part ot which was beautifully chrystal-lized. This circumstance might cause a doubt of its being a true vegetable; but its great resemblance to some of the mosses, particularly the byssi, and the discovery which Mr. Dunbar made, of its being the residence of animal life, confirmed his belief in its being a true moss. After a dilligent search, he discovered a very minute shell fish, of the bivalve kind, inhabiting this moss, its shape nearly that of the fresh water muscle, the color of the shell a greyish brown, with spots of a purplish color. When the animal is undisturbed, it opens its shell, and thrusts out four legs, very transparent, and articulated like those of a quadruped. The extremities of the fore legs are very slender and sharp, but those of the hind legs somewhat broader, apparently armed with minute toes. From the extremity of each shell issues three or four forked hairs, which the animal seems to possess the power of moving. The fore legs are probably formed lor making incisions into the moss, for the purpose of procuring access to the .juices of the living plant, upon which, no doubt, it feeds. It may be provided with a proboscis, although it did not appear while the animal was under examination. The hind legs are well adapted for propelling it in its progress over the moss, or through the water. It would be desirable to ascertain the cause of that perpetual fire which keeps tip the high temperature of so many springs as flow from this hill, at a considerable distance from each other. Upon looking around, however, sufficient data for the solution of the difficulty is not discoverable. Nothing of a volcanic nature is to be seen in this country. Neither could they learn that any evidence, in favor of such a supposition, was to be found in the mountains connected with this river. An immense bed of dark blue scliistus appears to form the base of the hot spring hill, and of all those in its neighborhood. The bottom of the creek is formed of it; and pieces are frequently met with, rendered soft by decomposition, and possessing a strong allutninous taste, requiring nothing but lixivation, and chrystalization, to complete tne manufacture of alum. As bodies undergoing chemical changes generally produce an alteration of temperature, the heat of these springs may be owing to the disengagement of calorie, or the decomposition of the scliistus. Another, and, perhaps, a more satisfactory cause maybe assigned: it is well known, that, within the circle of the waters of this river, vast beds of martial pyrites exist: they have not yet, however, been discovered in the vicinage of the hot springs, blit may, nevertheless, form immense beds under the bases of these hills, and as in one place, at least, there is evidence of the presence of bitumen.* The union of these agents will, in the progress of decomposition, by the admission of air ami moisture, produce degrees of heat capable of supporting the phenomena of hot springs. No sulphuric acid is present in this water; the springs may be supplied by the vapor ot heated water ascending from caverns where the heat is generated; or the heat may be immediately applied to the bottom of an immense natural cauldron of rock, contained in the bowels of the hill, from which, as a reservoir, the springs may be supplied. A series of accurate observations determined the latitude of the hot springs to be 34° 31' 4.1C" north, and longitude fill. It' 25", or 92° 50' 45" west from the meridian of Greenwich. While Mr. Dunbar was making arrangements for transporting the baggage back to the river camp, Doctor Hunter, with a small party, went on an excursion into the country. He left the hot springs on the morning of the 27th, and after travelling, sometimes over hills and steep craggy mountains, with narrow valleys between them, then up the valleys, and generally by the side of a branch emptying into the Washita, they reached the main branch of the Calfat in the evening, about twelve miles from the springs. The stones they met with, during the first part of the day, were silicious, of a whitish grey, with flints, white, cream colored, red, &c. The beds of the rivulets, and often a considerable way up the hills, shewed immense bodies of scliistus, both blue and grey: some of it efflorescing and tasting strongly of alum. The latter part of the day they travelled over, and between hills of black, hard, compact flint, in shapeless masses, with scliistus, as before. On ascending these high grounds, you distinctly perceive the commencement of the piny region; beginning at the height of sixty or seventy feet, and extending to the top. The soil in these narrow valleys is thin and full of stones. The next day, which was stormy, they reached a branch of the Bayou de Saline, which stretches towards the Arkansas, and empties into the Washita many leagues below, having gone about twelve miles. The mountains they had passed being of the primitive kind, which seldom produce metals, and having hitherto seen nothing of a mineral kind, a little poor iron ore excepted, and the face of the country, as far as they could see, presenting the same aspect, they returned to the camp at the hot springs, on the evening of the 30th, by another route; in which, they met with nothing worthy notice. In consequence of the rains which had fallen, Mr. Dunbar, and those who were transporting the baggage to the river camp, found the road watery. The soil on the flat lands, under the stratum of vegetable mould, is yellowish, and consists of decomposed scliistus, of which there are immense beds in every stage of dissolution, from the hard stone, recently uncovered, and partially decomposed, to the yellow and apparently homogeneous earth. The covering of vegetable mould between the hills and river, is, in the most places, sufficiently thick to constitute a good soil, being from four to six incites; and it is the opinion of the people upon the Washita, that wheat will grow here to great perfection, although the higher hills, three hundred to six hundred feet in height, are very rocky; yet, the * Having thrust a stick down into the crater of one of the springs, at some distance up tile hill/ Several drops of petroleum, or naptha, rose, and spread upon the surface. It ceased to rise, after three or four attempts. inferior hills, and the sloping bases of the first, are generally covered with a soil of a middling quality. The natural productions are sufficiently luxuriant, consisting chiefiy of black and red oak, intermixed with a variety of other woods, and a considerable undergrowth. Even on these vocky hills, are three or four species of vines, said to pro-: duce, annually, an exuberance ol excellent grapes. A great variety of plants, which grow here, some of which, in their season, are said to produce flowers highly ornamental, would probably reward the researches of the botanist. On the morning of the 8th January, 1805, the party left Ellis’s, on the river oamp, where they had been detained for several days, waiting for such a rise in the waters of the river, as would carry their boat in safety over the numerous rapids below'. A rise of about six feet, which had taken place the evening before, determined them to move this morning; and they passed the chutes about one o’clock. They stopped to examine the rocky promontory below these lulls, and took some specimens of the stone, which so_ much resemble the turkey oil stone. It appears too hard. The strata of this chain was observed to run perpendicularly, nearly east and west, crossed by fissures at right angles, from five to eight feet apart; the lamina, from one-fourth of an inch to five inches in thickness. About a league below, they landed at Whetstone Hill, and took several specimens. This projecting hill, is a mass of greyish blue schistus, of considerable hardness, and about tw enty feet perpendicular, not regufarly so; and, from a quarter to two inches in thickness, but does not split with an even surface. ■ They landed again on the morning of the 9th, in sight of the Bayou de la prairie de Champignole, to examine and lake specimens of some free stone, and blue slate: the slate is a blue schistus, hard, brittle, and unfit for the covering of a house; none proper for that purpose have been discovered, except on the Calfat, which Doctor Hunter met with in one of his excursions. On the evening of the 10th, they encamped near “Arclon’s troughs,” having been only three days in descending the distance, which took them thirteen to ascend. They stopped sometime at the camp of a Mr. Le Fevre. He is an intelligent man, a native of the Illinois, but now residing at the Arkansas. He came there with some Delaware and other Indians, whom he had fitted out with goods; and receives their peltry, fur, &c. at a stipulated price, as it is brought in by the hunters. Mr. Le Fevre possesses considerable knowledge of the interior of the country; he confirms the accounts before obtained, that the hills or mountains which give rise to this little river, are in a manner insulated; that is, they are entirely shut in and enclosed by the immense plains, or prairies, which extend beyond the Red river to the south, and beyond the Missouri, or at least, some of its branches, to the north, and range along the eastern base of the great chain, or dividing ridge, commonly known by the name of the Sand hills, which separate the waters of the Mississippi from those which fall into the Pacific ocean. The breadth of this great plain is not well ascertained; it is said by some to be, at certain parts, or in certain directions, not less than two hundred leagues; but it is agreed by all that have a knowledge of the Western country, that the mean breadth is at least two-thirds of that distance. A branch of the Missouri, called the river Platte, or Shallow river, is said to take its rise so far south, as to derive its first waters from the neighborhood of the sources of the Red and Arkansas rivers. By the expression plains, or prairies, in this place, is not to be understood a dead flat, resembling certain savannas, whose soil is stiff and impenetrable, often under water, and bearing a coarse grass, resembling reeds. Very different are the Western prairies, which expression signifies only a country without timber. These prairies are neither flat nor hilly, but undulating into gently swelling lawns, and expanding into spacious valleys, in the centre of which is always found a little timber, growing on the banks of brooks and rivulets of the finest water. The whole of these prairies are represented to be composed of the richest and most fertile soil. Tlie most luxuriant and succulent herbage covers the surface of the earth, interspersed with millions of flowers and flowering shrubs, of the most ornamental kinds. Those who have viewed only a skirt of these prairies, speak of them with a degree of enthusiasm, as il it was only there that nature was to be found truly perfect: they declare, that the fertility anti beauty of the rising grounds, the extreme richness of the vales, the coolness and excellent quality of the water found in every valley, the salubrity of the atmosphere, and above all, the grandeur of the enchanting landscape which this country presents, inspires the soul with sensations not to be felt in any other region of the globe. This paradise is now very thinly inhabited by a few tribes of savages, and by the immense herds of wild cattle (bison) which people these countries. The cattle perform regular migrations, according to the seasons, from south to north, and from the plains to the mountains; and in due time, taught by'their instincts, take a retrograde direction. These tribes move in the rear of their herds, and pick up stragglers, and such as lag behind, which they kill with the bow and arrow, for their subsistence. This country is not subjected to those sudden deluges of rain, which, in most hot countries, and even in the Mississippi territory, tear up, and sweep away with irresistible fury, the crop and soil together: on the contrary, rain is said to become more rare in proportion as the great chain of mountain is approached; and it would seem that, within the sphere of the attraction of those elevated ridges, little or no rain falls upon the adjoining plains. This relation is the more credible, as in that respect our new country may resemble other flat, or comparatively low countries, similarly situated; such as the country lying between the Andes and the western Pacific. The plains are supplied with nightly dews, so extremely abundantas to have the effect of refreshing showers of rain; and the spacious valleys, which are extremely level, may, with facility, be watered by the rills and brooks, which are never absent from these situations. Such is the description of the better known country lying to the south of the Red river from Nacogdoches towards St. Antonio, in the province of Texas. The richest crops are said to be procured there without rain; but, agriculture, in that quarter, is at a low ebb; the small quantities of mai'/.e furnished by the country, are said to be raised without cultivation. A rude opening is made in the earth, sufficient to deposite the grain at the distance of four or five feet in irregular squares, and the rest is left to nature. The soil is tender, spongy, and rich, and seems always to retain humidity sufficient, with the bounteous dews of Heaven, to bring the crops to maturity. The Red and Arkansas rivers, whose courses are very long, pass through portions of this fine country; they are both navigable, to an unknown distance, by boats of proper construction; the Arkansas river is, however, understood to have greatly the advantage with respect to the facility of navigation. Some difficult places are met with in the Red river, below the Natchitoches, after which, it is good, for one hundred and fifty leagues, (probably computed leagues of the country, about two miles each.) There the voyager meets with a very serious obstacle—the commencement of the “raft,” as it is called; that is, a natural covering, which conceals the whole river, for an extent of seventeen leagues, continually augmenting by the drift wood brought down by every considerable fresh. _ This covering, which for a considerable time was only drift wood, now supports a vegetation of every thing abounding in the neighboring forest, not excepting trees of considerable size; and the river may be frequently passed, without any knowledge of its existence. It is said that the annual inundation is opening for itself a new passage, through the low grounds, near the hills; but it must be long before nature, unaided, will excavate a passage sufficient for the waters of Red river. About fifty leagues above this natural bridge, is the residence of the Cadaux, or Cadadoquis nation, whose good qualities are already mentioned. The inhabitants estimate the post of Natchitoches to be half way between New Orleans and the Cadeaux nation. Above this point, the navigation of Red river is said to be embarrassed by many rapids, falls, and shallows. The Arkansas river is said to present, a safe, agreeable, and uninterrupted navigation, as high as it is known. The lands on each side, are of the best quality, and well watered with springs, brooks, and rivulets, affording many situations for mill seats. From description, it would seem, that, along this river, there is a regular gradation of hill and dale, presenting their extremities to the river; the hills are gently swelling eminences, and the dales, spacious valleys, with living water meandering through them; the forests consistof handsome trees, chiefly what is called open woods, without cane brake, or much underwood. The quality of the land is supposed superior to that on Red river, until it ascends to the prairie country, where the lands on both rivers are probably similar. About two hundred leagues up the Arkansas is an interesting place, called the Salt prairie; there is a considerable fork of the river there, and a kind of savanna, where the salt water is continually oozing out, and spreading over the surface of a plain. During the dry summer season, the salt may be raked up in large heaps; a natural crust, of a hand-breadth in thickness, is formed at this season. This place is not often frequented, on account of the danger from the Osage Indians; much less dare tlm white hunters venture to ascend higher,’where it is generally believed that silver is to be found. It is further said,1 that, high up the Arkansas river, salt is found in form of a solid rock, and may be dug out with the crowbar. The waters of the Arkansas, like those of Red river, are not potable during the dry season, being both charged highly with a reddish earth or marl, and extremely brackish. This inconvenience is not greatly felt upon the Arkansas, where springs and brooks of fresh water are frequent; the lied river is understood not to be so highly favored. Every account seems to move, that immense natural magazines of salt must exist in the great chain of mountains to the westward; as, all the rivers, in the summer season, which tlow from them, are strongly impregnated with that mineral, and are only rendered pajatable after receiving the numerous streams of fresh water, which join them in their course. The great W estern prairies, besides the herds of wild cattle (bison, commonly called buffalo), are also stocked with vast numbers of a wild goat, (not resembling the domestic goat) extremely swift footed. As the description given of this goat is not perfect, it may, from its swiftness, prove to be the antelope; or. it may, possibly, be a goat which has escaped from the Spanish settlements of New Mexico. A Canadian, who had been much with the Indians, to the westward, speaks of a wool-bearing animal, larger than a sheep; the wool much mixed with hair, which he had seen in large flocks; he pretends, also, to have seen the unicorn, the single horn of which, he says, rises out of the forehead, and curls back, conveying the idea of the fossil cornu ammonis." This man says, he has travelled beyond the great dividing ridge, so far as to have seen a large river, flowing to the westward. The great dividing mountain is so lofty, that it requires two days to ascend from the base to its top; other ranges of inferior mountains lie before and behind it; they are all rocky and sandy; large lakes and valleys lie between the mountains. Some of the lakes are so large as to contain considerable islands, and rivers flow from some of them. Great numbers of fossil bones, of very large dimensions, are seen among the mountains, which the Canadian supposed to be of the elephant. He does not pretend to have seen any of the precious metals, but has seen a mineral which he supposed might yield copper. From the top of the high mountain, the view is bounded by a curve, as upon the ocean, and extends over the most beautiful prairies, which seem to be unbounded, particularly towards the east. The finest of the lands he has seen, are on the Missouri; no other can compare in richness and fertility with them. This Canadian, as well as Le Fevre. speak of the Usages, of the tribe of White Hairs, as lawless and unprincipled ; and the other Indian tribes hold them in abhorrence, as a barbarous and uncivilized race; and the different nations who hunt in their neighborhood have been concerting plans for their destruction. On the morning of the 11th, the party passed the petit ecoreci Fubri. The osier w hich grows on the beaches above, is not seen below upon this river; and here they began to meet with the small tree, called “eharnier,” which grows only on the water side, and is met with all the way down the Washita. The latitude of 33° 4O', seems the northern boundary of the one, and the southern boundary of the other of these vegetables. Having noticed the limits set to the long moss, (tilandria) on the ascent of the river, in latitude 33°, Mr. Dunbar made inquiry of Mr. Le Fevre, as to its existence on the Arkansas settlement, which is known to lie in about the same parallel; he said, that its growth is limited about ten miles south of the settlement, and that, as remarkably, as if a line had been drawn east and west for the purpose; as it ceases all at once, and not by degrees. Hence, it appears that nature has marked, with a distinguishing feature, the line established by Congress between the Orleans and Louisiana terrri-tories. The cypress is not found on the Washita, higher than thirty four degrees of North latitude. In descending the river, they found their rate of going to exceed that of the current about six miles and a half, in twenty-four hours; and that, on the Pith, they had passed the apex of the tide, or wave occasioned by the fresh, and were descending along an inclined plane, as they encamped at night; they found themselves in deeper water the next morning, and on a more elevated part of the inclined plane than they hail been in the preceding evening, from the progress of the apex of the tide during their repose. At noon, on the tilth, they readied the post of the Washita. Mr. Dunbar being anxious to reach Natchez., as early as possible, and being unable to procure horses at the post, took a canoe, with one soldier, and his own domestic, to push down to the Catahoola, from whence to Concord, there is a road of thirty miles, across the low grounds. He set off’ early on the morning of the doth, and at night reached the settlement of an old hunter, with whom he had conversed on his way up the river. This man informed him, that, at the place called the Mine, on the Little Missouri, there is a smoke which ascends perpetually from a particular place, and that the vapour is sometimes insupportable. The river, ora branch of it. passes over a bed of mineral, which, from the description given, is, no doubt, martial pyrites. In a creek or branch ol the fourche a Luke*, there is found, on the beaches, and in the cliffs, a great number of globular bodies, some as large, or larger, than a man's head; which, when broken, exhibit the appearance of gold, silver, and precious stones; most probably, pyrites and chrystalized spar. And at the ''fourche ila> glaUcs a Paul,]" near the river, there is a cliff full of hexagonal prisms, terminated by pyramids, which appear to grow out of the rock; they are from six to eight inches in length, and some of them an inch in diameter. There are beds of pyrites found in several small creeks communicating with the Washita; but it appears that the mineral indications are greatest on the Little Missouri, because, as before noted, some of the hunters actually worked on them, and sent a parcel of the ore to New Orleans. It is the belief here, that the mineral contained precious, metal, but that the Spanish Government did not choose a mine should be opened so near to the British settlements. An express prohibition was issued against working these mines. _ At this place Mr Dunbar obtained one or two slips of the "bois d’arc.” (bow wood) or yellow wood, from the Missouri. The fruit which had fallen before maturity, lav’ upon the ground ; some were of the size of a small orange, with a rind full of tubercles; the color, though it appealed faded, still retained a resemblance to pale gold. The tree, in its native soil, when laden with its golden fruit, (nearly as large as the egg of an ostrich), presents the most splendid appearance; its foliage is of a deep green, resembling the varnished leaf of the orange tree, and upon the whole, no forest tree can compare with it in ornamental grandeur. The bark of the young tree resembled in texture the dogwood bark; the appearance of the wood recommends it for trial, as an article which may yield a yellow dye. It is deciduous, the branches are numerous, and full of short thorns or prickles, which seem to point it out as proper for hedges, or live fences. This tree is known to exist near the Natchitoches (perhaps in latitude 3-2c) and upon the river Arkansas high up, (perhaps in latitude 36°); it is. therefore, probable that it may thrive from latitude 38° to 40% and will be a great acquisition to the United States, if it possess no other merit than that of being ornamental. In descending the river, both Mr. Dunbar and Dr. Hunter searched for the place said to yield gypsum, or plaster of Paris, but failed. The former gentleman states that he has no doubt of its existence; having noted two places where it has been found; one of which is the first hill or high land which touches the river on the west, above Bayou Calumet, and the other is the second high land on the same side. As these are two points of the same continued ridge, it is probable that an immense body of gypsum will be found in the bowels of the hill where they meet, and perhaps extending far beyond them. On the evening of the twenty-second, Mr. Dunbar arrived at the Catahoola, where a Frenchman, of the name of Hebrard, who keeps the ferry across Black river, is settled. Here the road from the Washita forks, one branch of it leading to the settlements on Red river, the other up to the post of the Washita. 'The proprietor of this place has been a hunter, and a great traveller up the 'Washita, and into the Western country; he confirms, generally, the accounts received from others. It appears, from what they say, that, in the neighborhood of the hot springs, but higher up. among the mountains, and upon the Little Missouri, during the summer season, explosions are very frequently heard, proceeding from under the ground. And, not rarely, a curious phenomenon is seen, which is termed the blowing of the mountains; it is confined elastic gas, forcing a passage through the side or top of a hill, driving before it a great quantity of earth or mineral matter. During the winter season the explosions and blowing of the mountains entirely cease, from whence we may conclude that the cause is comparatively superficial, being brought into action by the increased heat of the more direct rays of the summer sun. The confluence of the Washita, Catahoola, and Tensa, is an interesting place. The last of these communicates with the Mississippi loyv lands, by the intervention of other creeks and lakes, and by one in particular, called “Bayou iI’Argent.” which empties into the Mississippi about fourteen miles above Natchez.. During high water there is a navigation for batteaux. of any burthen, along the Bayou. A large lake, called St. John’s lake, occupies * Three leagues above Kills’ camp. f Higher up the river than fourche a Luke. 94 a considerable part of the passage between tlm Mississippi and the Tensa; it is in a horse-shoe form, anti has, at some former period, been the bed of the Mississippi. The nearest part of it is about one mile removed from the river, at the present time. This lake, possessing elevated banks, similar to those of the river, has been lately occupied and improved. The Catahoola bayou is the third navigable stream; during the time of the inundation, there is an excellent communication by the lake of that name, and from thence, by large creeks, to the Red river. The country around the point of union of these three rivers, is altogether alluvial; but the place of Mr. Hebrard’s residence is no longer subject to inundation. There is no doubt, that, as the country augments in population and.riches, this place will become the site of a commercial inland town, which will keep pace with the progress and prosperity of the country. One of the Indian mounts here is of a considerable elevation, with a species of rampart surrounding a large space, which was, no doubt, the position of a fortified town. While here, Mr. Dunbar met with an American, who pretended to have been up the Arkansas river three hundred leagues. The navigation of this river, he says, is good to that distance, for boats drawing three or four feet water. Implicit faith, perhaps, ought not to be given to his relation respecting the quantity of silver he pretends to have collected there. He says he has found silver on the Washita, thirty leagues above the hot springs, so rich, that three pounds of it yielded one pound of silver; and that this was found in a cave. He asserts, also, that the ore of the mine upon the Tuttle Missouri was carried to Kentucky, by a person of the name of Boon, where it was found to yield largely in silver. This man says he has been up. the Red river likewise; and that there is a great rapid just below the raft, or natural bridge, and several others above it: that the Cadeaux nation is about fifty ^leagues above the raft, and near to their village commences the country of the great prairies, which extend four or five hundred miles west, to the Sand mountains, as they are termed. These great plains reach far beyond the Red river to the south, and northward over the Arkansas river, and among the numerous branches of the Missouri. He confirms the account of the beauty and fertility of the Western country. On the morning of the twenty-fifth, Mr. Dunbar set out on horseback, from the Catahoola to Natchez. The rain which had fallen on the preceding days, rendered the roads wet and muddy, and it was two in the afternoon before he reached the bayou Crocodile, which is considered half way between the Black river and the Mississippi. It is one of the numerous creeks in the low grounds, which assist in venting the waters of the inundation. On the margin of the water courses the lands are highest, and produce canes; they fall off in the rear, into cypress swamps and lakes. The waters of the Mississippi were rising, and it was with some difficulty that they reached a house near Concord that evening. This settlement was begun since the cession of Louisiana to the United States, by citizens of the Mississippi territory, who have established their residence altogether upon newly acquired lands, taken up under the authority of the Spanish commandant, and have gone to the expense of improvement, either in the names of themselves, or others, before the twentieth of December, 1803, lioping, thereby, to hold their new possessions under the sanction of the law. Exclusive of the few actual residents on the banks of the Mississippi, there are two very handsome lakes in the interior, on the banks of which similar settlements have been made. He crossed at the ferry, and at mid-day of the twenty-sixth, reached his own house. Dr. Hunter, and the remainder of the party, followed Mr. Dunbar down the W ashita, with the boat in which they ascended the river, and, ascending the Mississippi, reached St. Catherine’s Landing on the morning of the 31st January, 1805.
