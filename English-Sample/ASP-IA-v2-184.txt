The draughtsman of this office having carefully examined the enclosed, informs me that it is impossible to make any estimate of the quantity of land embraced by the cessions alluded to, on account of the uncertainty of their boundaries, except in the case of the cession under treaty with the Chickasaws of the 19th day of October, 1818, where it is estimated that the total quantity embraced by the limits of that cession, agreeably to a calculation from Melish’s map of the United States, is 6,675,840 acres, of which 1,120,000 are situated in Kentucky, and 5,555,840 in Tennessee. If the boundaries of the cessions could be ascertained with any degree of precision, the information sought for would be afforded with pleasure. 1 have the honor to be, &c. JOSIAH MEIGS. Hon. J. C.
