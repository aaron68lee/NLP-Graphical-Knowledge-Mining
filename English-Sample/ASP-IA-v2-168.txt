At the commencement of the Revolution, large importations of goods were ordered by Congress to be imported by the Secret Committee of that honorable body, (Journal, page 41, January 27, 1776,) and were to be placed at the disposition of the commissioners of the Northern Department, including Canada, also the commissioners of the Middle Department and the commissioners of the Southern Department. This amount is assumed as an expenditure from the Treasury, because the moneys were advanced to the committee, and expended in the purchase of articles of domestic produce for exportation. Of the actual arrival of the articles, and their distribution by the commissioners who were appointed for the management of Indian affairs, we have not any existing records; it was, however, an object to which the Government of the United States paid great attention, as expressed by their resnlution of the 5th of February following: “ That a friendly commerce between the people of the United Colonies and the Indians, and the propagation of the Gospel and the cultivation of the civil arts among the latter, may produce many and inestimable advantages to both; and that the commissioners for Indian affairs be desired to consider of proper places in their respective departments for the residence of ministers and schoolmasters.” The annual expenditures subsequently to the year 1777 were comparatively to a small amount, from circumstances incident to the operations of war, whereby the efforts of the Government were overruled. The nominal amount of expenditures is reduced to specie medium by the scale of depreciation. TREASURY DEPARTMENT, REGISTER’S OFFICE, November 8, 1820.	JOSEPH NOURSE, Register. No. 2.
