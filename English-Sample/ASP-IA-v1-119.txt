No. 119. [1st Sessiov. OTTAWAS AND OTHERS. COMMUNICATED TO THE HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES, JANUARY 30, 1808. To the House of Representatives of the United States: The posts of Detroit and Mackinac having been originally intended by the Governments which established and held them, as mere depots for commerce with the Indians, very small cessions of land around them were obtained, or asked, from the native proprietors, and those posts depended for protection on the strength of their garrisons. The principles of our Government leading us to the employment of such moderate garrisons, in time of peace, as may merely take care of the post, and to a reliance on the neighboring militia for its support, in the first moments of war, I have thought it would be important to obtain from the Indians such a cession in the neighborhood of these posts, as might maintain a militia proportioned to this object: and, 1 have particularly contemplated, with this view, the acquisition of the eastern moiety of the peninsula between the lakes Michigan, Huron, and Erie, extending it to the Connecticut reserve, so soon as it could be effected, with the perfect good will of the natives. By a treaty concluded at Detroit, on the seventeenth of November last, with the Ottawas, Chippewas, Wyan-dots, and Pattawatamies, so much of this country has been obtained, as extends from about Sagunia bay southwardly to the Miami of the lakes, supposed to contain upwards of five millions of acres, with a prospect of obtaining, for the present, a breadth of two miles for a communication from the Miami to the Connecticut reserve. The Senate having advised and consented to the ratification of this treaty, I now lay it before both Houses of Congress, for the exercise of their constitutional powers, as to the means of fulfilling it. TH: JEFFERSON. January 30, 1808. [Note. For treaty, see No. 116.] 10th Congress.]
