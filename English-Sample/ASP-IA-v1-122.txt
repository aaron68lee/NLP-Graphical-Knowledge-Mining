No. 122.[1st Session.] THE SIOUX. COMMUNICATED TO THE SENATE, APRIL 13, 1808. Mr. Mitchell from the committee to whom was referred Ihe message of the President of the United States, of March 29th, and the treaty with the Sioux tribes of Indians, made the following report: The amount of land ceded by the Sioux, is a tract of nine miles square, at the mouth of the river St. Croix, amounting to acres, - - - - . - - 51,840 And another tract, at the falls of St. Anthony, containing, by estimation, (18 miles by 9) a sum of acres equal to--------- - 103,680 Amounting, in the whole, to - - - - Acres,_ 155,520 This people had been induced to cede these tracts of land in consideration of about two hundred dollars’ worth of goods and merchandise, and of the benefit they would derive from the establishment of a trading house, and ot protection front a military station in their country. There is a blank in the second article, which the committee learn, from Captain Pike, was intended to be filled up with some valuable consideration, to vest the title fully and fairly in the United States. As the sum to be given by the United States is wholly optional and gratuitous, it is believed, by the agent, that two thousand dollars would be considered by the Sioux a very generous compensation. This amounts to not much more than one cent and twenty-eight mills the acre. The committee, after considering the agreement of the agent with the Sioux chiefs, and such information as they have been able to procure from Captain Pike thereon, report to the Senate the following amendment: After the word “ States,’’ in the second line of the second article, insert the following words: “ shall, prior to taking possession thereof, pay to the Sioux two thousand dollars, or deliver the value thereof in such goods and merchandise as they shall choose.” April VMh, 1808. * 1 10th Congress.]
