No. 21. [1st Session. THE CHEROKEES. COMMUNICATED TO THE SENATE, NOVEMBER 9, 1791. Mr. Hawkins, from the committee to whom was referred the message of the President of the United States, of the 26th of October last, transmitting a'treaty recently made with the Cherokee Indians, reported: That they have examined the said treaty, and find it strictly conformable to the instructions given by the President of the United States; That, these instructions were founded on the advice and consent of the Senate, of the 11th of August, 1790; That the stipulations in the 14th article are similar to those gratuitously promised to the Creeks; and, although they form an excess to the sum limited in the resolution aforesaid, yet, from the beneficial effects likely to be produced thereby, cannot be objectionable. That a new boundary has been arranged, which embraces the people settled to the south of French Broad, and between the same and the ridge which divides the waters running into Little river, and from those running into the Tennessee. That the boundary, in other respects, is nearly the same as that established at Hopewell. The committee are therefore of opinion, that the Senate advise and consent to the ratification of said treaty. 2nd Congress.]
