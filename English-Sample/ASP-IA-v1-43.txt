No. 43. [1st Session. THE WABASH TRIBES. COMMUNICATED TO THE SENATE, JANUARY 7, 1794. Gentlemen qf the Senate: I herewith transmit the copy of a letter from the Secretary of War, stating the circumstances which hate hitherto prevented any explanation of the fourth article of the treaty with the Wabash Indians. GEO. WASHINGTON. United States, 6tli January, 1794. War Department. January 2, 1794. Sir: Most of the principal chiefs of the Wabash Indians, who visited this city, having died with the small-pox, it would have been improper and nugatory to have attempted with the remainder any explanation of the fourth article of the treaty of Post Vincennes, the seventh day of September, 1792. It was presumed, that, at the intended treaty to be held with the Northwestern Indians, the Wabash tribes would have been represented. With a view therefore to this subject generally, the following article was inserted in the instructions of the commissioners: “ You will, in all your negotiations, carefully guard the general rights of pre-emption of the United States to the Indian country, agaiiist all other nations and individuals, as established by the treaty of 1783, with Great Britain. But, in describing these rights to the Indians, you will impress them with the idea, that we concede to them fully, the rightand possession of the soil as long as they desire to occupy the same: but when they choose to sell any portion of the country, it must be sold only to the United States, who will protect the Indians against all imposition.” But the expectation of the treaty having been frustrated, nothing has been effected upon the subject. I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, your obedient servant. H. KNOX, Secretary of War. The President of the United States. 17-94.] THE CREEKS. 471 Sd Congress.]
