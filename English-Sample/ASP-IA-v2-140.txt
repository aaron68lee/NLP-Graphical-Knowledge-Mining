I had the honor to transmit to you on the 24th ultimo a copy of the treaty of peace which was concluded on the 24th of December last between the United States and Great Britain at Ghent, and ratified by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, on the 17th ultimo. By the ninth article of this treaty it is stipulated that the United States shall put an end to all hostilities with the Indian tribes with whom they might be at war at the time of the ratification, and to restore to such tribes all the rights and privileges to which they were entitled previous to the war: provided that such tribes or hations should agree to desist from all hostilities against the United States of America, their citizens aod subjects, upon the ratification of such treaty being notified to such tribes or nations, and should so desist accordingly. By the same article it is also stipulated that His Britannic Majesty should likewise put an end, in like manner and on the same conditions, to hostilities with the tribes or nations of Indians with whom he might be at war at the time of the ratification of said treaty. It is incumbent on the United States to execute every article of this treaty with perfect good faith, and it is their firm resolution to do it. They wish to be particularly exact in the execution of the article above recited relating to the Indian tribes. For this purpose the President has, in consequence, appointed you commissioners with full power to conclude a treaty with all those tribes, for which I enclose you a commission. You will give immediate notice to all the tribes with whom the United States are at war on the Mississippi and its waters of the peace which has been concluded between the United States and Great Britain, and of the stipulations contained in it in regard to them; and you will likewise invite them to attend by a deputation of chiefs, at such place or places as you may appoint, for the purpose of concluding the proposed treaty of peace and amity between the United States and all those tribes. It is thought proper to confine this treaty to the sole object of peace. Other arrangements between the United States and the Indian tribes adapted to their mutual interests may be entered into hereafter. You will avail yourself of the opportunity to inform the Indian tribes that it is intended to establish strong posts very high up the Mississippi, and from the Mississippi to Lake Michigan, and to open trading-houses at those posts, or other suitable places for their accommodation. I have the honor to be, &c. J. MONROE. Gov. CLARK, GOV. EDWARDS, and AUGUSTE CHOUTEAU, Esq. GENTLEMEN:	WAR DEPARTMENT, March II, 1815. Colonel McNair has recommended Mr. Robert Wash as a gentleman well qualified to act as your secretary, and it is requested that he may be appoiuted.as such. I have the honor to be, &c. J. MONROE. Messrs. CLARK, EDWARDS, and Colonel CHOUTEAU. SIR:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, March 11, 1815. The commission for the commissioners to treat with the Indians with whom we were at war at the time the treaty with Great Britain was ratified, and instructions, are committed to Colonel McNair, who will likewise have the pleasure to deliver you this letter. Of this gentleman a very favorable opinion is entertained by the President, and had he not recommended and insisted on the appointment of Mr. Chouteau as third commissioner, he would have been appointed himself, as I have reason to believe. It had previously been determined to give him a respectable command, had the war continued, in the troops which were intended to have been raised in the western country. I mention these circumstances to show you the good opinion which is formed of him by the Government. Should any opportunity occur to enable the commissioners to avail themselves of his services with advantage in the proposed treaty with the Indians, it is desired you should do it; or should you find, hereafter, that he may be employed either with the Indians or in any other way in the Missouri Territory, or high up the Mississippi, I wish you to communicate it to the Government, and it will be considered.	'I have the honor to be, &c. His Excellency WILLIAM CLARK.	J. MONROE. SIR:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, March 13, 1815. Mr. Boilvin has been continued in the Indian agency which he has heretofore held. He will take his instructions from you, and will no doubt be useful in giving notice to the Indian tribes and nations, and inducing their chiefs to attend at the treaty which you are authorized to make with them. I have the honor to be, &c. His Excellency WILLIAM CLARK.	J. MONROE. SIR:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, March 25, 1815. At the treaty which you as one of the commissioners are authorized to hold with the Indians, the President thinks it will be proper to make some presents to the chiefs and headmen of the several tribes who may attend. For this purpose, twenty thousand dollars worth of goods have been directed to be purchased, and will be forwarded by Messrs. Johnson & Sibley, who will probably reach St. Louis with them in the first week in June. Whether it will be necessary to distribute the whole of these goods to the Indians, will depend upon the number of tribes which attend the treaty, and on the judgment and discretion of the commissioners as to the extent to which presents ought to be made. Should any Indians who have been friendly to the United States attend the treaty, it will be well, in the distribution of the presents, to let them feel that those who have been our enemies are not better treated than those who have been our friends. Among the articles to be sent out there will be some solid silver medals; and it having been understood that the late General Pike, when on his expedition up the Mississippi, took from some nf the Indians medals which had been given to them by the British, it is requested that, if any of these Indians attend the treaty, a medal of the largest size be given to each of them in lieu of those taken from them by General Pike. I have the honor to be, &c. His Excellency W. CLARK, St. Louis. SIR:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, March 27, 1815. You will please to procure and forward to Governor Clark, of the Missouri Territory, about $20,000 worth of goods, intended as presents at the treaty to be held with the Indians who reside on the waters of the Mississippi, and who have been at war with the United States. The goods will consist of blankets, strouds, cloths, calicoes, handkerchiefs, cotton stuffs, ribands, gartering, frock coats, flags, silver ornaments, paints, wampum, lookingglasses, knives, fire-steels, rifles, fusils, flints, powder, tobacco, pipes, needles, &c. These articles should be equal in quality to those which the Indians have been accustomed to receive from the British agents. I am, very respectfully, JAMES MONROE. Gen. JOHN MASON, Superintendent of Indian Trade, Georgetown. SIR:	ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI TERRITORY, May 15, 1815. We have the	honor to state	to you that, as commissioners	appointed	by the President to treat with the Indians on the Mississippi river and	its waters, we propose to hold	the treaty	at Portage des Sioux, (a few miles above the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers,) in the early part of July next; and presuming that there will be a large	assemblage of Indians, a guard calculated to	command	sufficient respect and to maintain order seems to us so	necessary, that	we beg leave to solicit such orders for those purposes as you may deem it expedient to give to the officer having command on this frontier. We have the honor, &c. WILLIAM CLARK, NINIAN EDWARDS, Hon. the SECRETARY OF WAR.	AUG. CHOUTEAU. SIR:	ST. Lours, May 22, 1815. Various indications of the continuance of a hostile disposition on the part of the Sacs and Foxes of Rock river towards onr Government and the citizens thereof, with some recent aggressions which they are with good reason supposed to have committed since they were fully notified of the ratification of the late treaty with Great Britain, and its stipulations in regard to them, induce us to consider a permanent peace with those tribes so doubtful that we feel it our duty most respectfully to suggest it as our opinion that it is highly expedient to be prepared for the alternative of war with them. In the mean time every effort in our power will be employed to effect a pacification in conformity to our instructions; for which purpose every necessary preparatory measure has been adopted. We have the honor, &c. WILLIAM CLARK, NINIAN EDWARDS, Hon. the SECRETARY OF WAR, Washington.	AUG. CHOUTEAU. SIR:	ST. LOUIS, May 22, 1815. Since writing the letter which we had the honor this day to address to you, we have received additional evidence of the determined hostility of the Sacs and others, of Rock river, in the murder of a family in the county of St. Charles on the day before yesterday. The conduct of those savages, in the cold indifference with which they received several communications in regard to the late treaty; their insolent deportment on those occasions; their perfidy in decoying on shore and murdering one of the messengers of peace; the murders and depredations which they have repeated since they were notified of the treaty, together with the suggestions and admonitions of the British officers themselves to be on our guard against them, leave no doubt on our minds that it is the intention of those tribes to continue the war, and that nothing less than a vigorous display of military force can change their disposition. Seeing that they have not agreed, on the notification of the ratification of the treaty, to desist from hostilities, and that they have not desisted, we feel very much at a loss to decide on the course proper to be pursued by us in relation to them. To treat with them (even if they should not eventually decline our overture) without requiring the surrender of the authors of the recent hostilities, or some other retributions, would, we fear, be of dangerous consequences in its influence on other tribes. But upon this subject we shall be very thankful for the instructions of the President, which we will endeavor faithfully to fulfil. We have the honor, &c. WILLIAM CLARK, NINIAN EDWARDS, Hon. the SECRETARY OF WAR, Washington City.	AUG. CHOUTEAU. SIR:	ST. LOUIS, May 2.7, 1815. I received, yesterday, your letter of the 13th of March last, enclosing me a commission of commissioner to conclude, conjointly with their excellencies Governors William Clark and Ninian Edwards, a treaty of peace with the different tribes of Indians of the Mississippi and its waters. I had already received the instructions you sent me by Col. McNair, and, consequently, acted accordingly, as you may know by the different letters w§ had the honor to write you. I have accepted willingly this appointment; the more so, as I expect that my zeal to perform my duty will equal the confidence you have been pleased to bestow upon, Sir, your most obedient servant, AUG. CHOUTEAU. The Hon. JAMES MONROE, Secretary of War. GENTLEMEN:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, June. 11, 1815. I have received and laid before the President your communication dated the 15th ultimo. The President regrets the hostile dispositions of the Indians; but having executed, in perfect good faith, the stipulations of the treaty of Ghent, he will exert the military powers of the Government to secure the peace and safety of the country. It is presumed that Colonel Miller, with his detachment, arrived at St. Louis soon after the date of your letters, and the enclosed copy of a letter to General Jackson will show the general matters in operation to resist and punish the further aggressions of the Indians on the waters of the Mississippi. Colonel Miller will also be authorized to continue the rangers in service, and to obtain an immediate reinforcement of militia, if the exigencies should be such as to preclude an application to this Department or to Major General Jackson. The President has been induced, by the representations from the northwest, to appoint Governor Harrison, General McArthur, and Mr. Graham, commissioners to treat with the Indian tribes in that quarter. As the principles contained in the instructions to those commissioners may be usefully applied in the execution of your trust, I am authorized to communicate, confidentially, the enclosed copy for your information and government. I am, very respectfully, &c. A. J. DALLAS. Governor CLARK, of the Missouri Territory, Governor EDWARDS, of the Illinois Territory, and Mr. CHOUTEAU, Commissioners appointed to negotiate a treaty with certain Indian tribes. SIR:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, June 14, 1815. The representations which have been made to the President relative to the dispositions of the Indians in various quarters induce him to apprize your excellency of the measures that have been taken since the ratification of the treaty of Ghent to restore peace with the Indian tribes, and to conciliate the good-will of the misinformed or the discontented. As this object will be easiest effected by communicating to you the instructions given to the commissioners for treating with the Northwest Indians, I have the honor to transmit (in confidence) the enclosed copy. If the hostility of the Indians on the waters of the Mississippi should continue, or if in any other quarter danger should be apprehended, the officer commanding the troops of the United States may require the aid of the militia to resist and repel aggression. Under such circumstances, there may not be time to apply to this Department, and the officer is authorized to address himself, at once, to the Governors of the States or Territories from which assistance can be drawn with the greatest promptitude and facility. Should an application be made to your excellency, the President relies upon the benefit of your effective co-operation and good offices. I have the honor to be, &c. A. J. DALLAS. The GOVERNORS of Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia, Indiana Territory, and Mississippi Territory. SIR:	MISSOURI TERRITORY, PORTAGE DES SIOUX, July 16, 1815. We have the honor to inform you that we met at this place, according to appointment, on the 6th instant, and have been constantly engaged in endeavoring to discharge the trust confided to us. We are very sorry, however, to be obliged to state that the prospects of restoring tranquillity and safety to this frontier, by an amicable accommodation with the Indians, are not at all flattering. With the Pattawatamies of Illinois river, and the small band of Piankeshaws who are prisoners of war, we shall probably conclude a treaty in a day or two. But neither the Winnebagoes, Sacs, Foxes, loways, Kickapoos, or any others residing upon Rock river, have sent forward competent deputations of chiefs to treat with us. The Sacs and Foxes, in particular, have committed many flagitious acts of hostility since they were notified of the late treaty with Great Britain and the overtures of our Government to themselves. Some of the most insignificant and -contemptible wretches of these tribes, with one chief only, met us at this place. They acknowledged that they had no power to treat with us; and the chief that did attend is understood to have declared that, even if a treaty should be concluded with all the chiefs, those tribes would never consent to relinquish the lands which they have heretofore ceded to us. By their own confessions, some of their war parties have very recently made incursions into our frontier, from which a number of horses have been stolen within a few days; and even since the treaty commenced, they have waylaid and attacked some of the citizens of this Territory. All these considerations induce us to think it very doubtful whether any treaty, upon the terms we are authorized to offer, can be effected with them. And as the lands they have heretofore ceded extend from the mouth of the Illinois river to the mouth of the Ouisconsin, and include the favorite residence of a great number of the hostile Indians, we do not believe that they would permit the military lands included within those boundaries to be surveyed, if they should eventually, for mere temporary purposes, be induced to conclude a treaty with us. We are happy to state that the dispositions manifested by the Missouri Indians, generally, seem to be friendly, and some of them are anxious to unite with us in the war against the Sacs and Foxes. We have the honor to transmit, herewith, the copy of a letter which we felt it our duty to address to the commanding officer in this district. We have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servants, WILLIAM CLARK, NINIAN EDWARDS, To the Hon. SECRETARY OF WAR.	AUGTE. CHOUTEAU. SIR:	PORTAGE DES SIOUX, July 11, 1815. As commissioners appointed to negotiate a treaty of peace with the tribes of Indians residing upon the Mississippi and its waters, who, at the time of the ratification of the treaty with Great Britain, were at war with the United States, we, in conformity to our instructions, notified those tribes of the peace that had been concluded, and of the stipulations it contained in regard to themselves, and at the same time invited them to attend, by a deputation of chiefs, at this place, on the 6th instant, for the purpose of concluding a treaty of peace and amity between the United States and themselves. The friendly overtures of the Government, however, do not appear to have been met by a correspondent disposition on the part of those tribes. None of them have as yet sent forward sufficient deputations to treat with us; several of them have not sent a single man, nor have we any ground to expect they will do so; and while a considerable number of the most insignificant and contemptible persons of the Sacs and Foxes of Rock river have attended, without more than one chief, we have been informed, and have reason to believe, that their principal chiefs and warriors continue to cherish the most inveterate and deadly hostility towards the American people and Government, and that war parties from those tribes recently started for our frontier; which statement is rendered the more probable by the occurrence of some very late acts of hostility (of which they had previously committed many) since they were informed of the peace. The Kickapoos sent one chief only, and there are strong grounds to believe that they have identified themselves with the Sacs and Foxes io their late hostilities, and that they participate their present unfriendly disposition. Those three tribes left here privately last night, and we feel it our duty to state to you as our opinion, that the exertion of the military power of the Government will be necessary to secure the peace and safety of this country. SIR:	PORTAGE DES SIOUX, July 22, 1815. We have the honor to inform you that we have succeeded in concluding separate treaties of peace and friendship with the following tribes of Indians, viz: the Pattawatamies of Illinois river, the Piankeshaws, Yanctons, Teetons, Mahas, Sioux of the Lakes, (residing between Prairie du Chien and the river St. Petbr’s,) and the Sioux of the river St. Peter’s. We feel peculiar pleasure in acknowledging the prompt and useful assistance and co-operation afforded us in the discharge of our duties by Colonel Miller, whose whole conduct, as far as it has come under our observation, fully evinces that he merits all that honorable distinction which the Government of his country has bestowed upon him. From various indications of the settled hostility of the Sacs and Foxes, Kickapoos, Winnebagoes, &c. of the Rock river, and particularly from some additional depredations which some of them have committed since the date of our last letter, we fear there is little ground to hope that a conflict with them can be avoided with either honor to the Government or safety to this country. We have the honor to be, very respectfully, sir, your most obedient servants, WILLIAM CLARK, NINIAN EDWARDS, To the lion. SECRETARY OF WAR.	AUG. CHOUTEAU. SIR:	ST. LOUIS, September 18, 1815. We have the honor to inform you that, since our last communications, we have concluded treaties of peace with the Kickapoos, Big and Little Osages, Sacs of the Missouri river, Foxes, and loways. A considerable backwardness, if not positive reluctance, on the part of several tribes, in accepting the overtures of peace which we were authorized to offer them, has been very manifest. The Sacs of Rock river have ultimately refused to treat with us in the most positive manner; speak, without disguise, of their opposition to military establishments on the Mississippi river; and have continued to commit occasional but serious depredations on this frontier. By information recently received from Mr. Builvin, agent at Prairie du Chien, the Indians about that place appear to be in considerable commotion, and are much divided among themselves with regard to peace with the United States. A number of British traders, with goods to a great amount, on which they have paid no duties, have arrived on the Mississippi, and we feel well assured that many of the difficulties that have occurred with the Indians, and which still continue, are justly attributable to that class of people. Lieutenant Kennedy, who was sent out for some of the more distant tribes of Indians, not having returned, and there yet being some prospect of other tribes coming in, we have adjourned to this place, and hope to finish our business in a few days, when we shall forward the report of our proceedings. We have the honor to be, most respectfully, WILLIAM CLARK, NINIAN EDWARDS, Hon. WM. H. CRAWFORD, Secretary of Har.	AUGTE. CHOUTEAU. SIR:	ST. LOUIS, October 18, 1815. Being about to finish all the duties which, as commissioners appointed to treat with the Indians of the Mississippi and its waters, it is possible for us to perform in the present year, we feel it incumbent on us to give you a more minute detail of our proceedings, and of the causes that have protracted our duties to the present time, than has hitherto been transmitted to the Department over which you preside. On the 11th May we met at this place, which was as soon after the receipt of our commissions and instructions as was practicable. Our first duty being to send invitations, according to our instructions, to the different tribes or nations of Indians with whom the United States were at war at the time of the ratification of their late treaty with Great Britain, every effort in our power was employed to procure proper persons for that purpose; but in this success was, for some time, unattainable. Several of the hostile tribes had previously been notified by the Governors of this and Illinois Territory of the treaty, and the stipulations it contained in regard to themselves; but, contrary to every reasonable expectation, the intelligence thus-communicated seemed to have generated new and additional hostility, which was so repeatedly developed in the most flagitious depredations and massacres on the frontiers as to produce universal alarm. Those acts of hostility appearing to increase rather than diminish, after we commenced our duties, rendered it extremely difficult to engage any persons to go into the Indian country; subjected us to disappointments by some whose fears prevented them from fulfilling engagements after they had made them; put it out of our power then to send to several of the tribes, and caused our missions to be more expensive, in consequence of having to send a greater number of men together, and sending up a party in a fortified boat, as a necessary precaution, to guard against danger, without which they could not have been induced to go upon any terms. Having at length eventually succeeded in procuring some men for the purpose, we prepared and sent off thirtyseven talks, (of which a copy is herewith transmitted,) directed to different tribes, hoping that our messengers might be able to engage Indians to carry some of those talks tu those places where it would otherwise have been impossible for us to have sent them. In some instances, the Indians having left their villages and gone to their summer’s 2 E hunt, our messengers were unable to find them; in consequence of which we had to wait for further information, and send again. The messengers whom we had engaged to go by the direct route to Prairie du Chien were stopped at the mouth of Rock, river by the Sacs, who would permit them to proceed no farther. This event, however, we had anticipated, and had previously determined to send some person (if one could be procured) up to the Mahas on the Missouri, thence to pass over by land to the river St. Peter’s, and thence to Prairie du Chien. This mission we deemed very important for several reasons: 1st. It was well ascertained the British had been endeavoring, and with some success too, to engage the Indians of the Missouri river in the war against us. It was therefore necessary, to prevent those machinations from eventuating in hostilities, that we should apprize the tribes upon whom they had been practised of the new state of relations between ours and the British Government, as there was no reason to believe that the latter would have caused any such information to be there communicated. 2d. By the authority, and under the directions of the Governor of this Territory, with the promised co-operation of General Howard, while commanding in this district, a part of the Sioux, and other Indians of the Missouri, had been engaged in the war on our side, and were then at war with those Indians who had been hostile to us, several of whom they had killed after our treaty commenced. As, then, the war thus instigated must have been considered as the act of our Government, good faith, in consequence of the treaty with Great Britain, required that it should cease. 3d. The Government having determined to establish strong military posts high up the Mississippi river, and there then being reason to believe it would have been attempted within the past season, it was desirable that the Indians of the river St. Peter’s, and others in the vicinity of Prairie du Chien, should be made acquainted with the views and intentions of our Government, as such movements, if unexplained, would naturally have excited in them fearful apprehensions, in consequence of their having been engaged in the war, and might have put it in the power of the most contemptible British trader to have produced a serious opposition in that quarter. 4th. Our instructions positively required that we should give immediate information to those tribes of the peace that had been concluded between the United States and Great Britain, and we saw no other practicable means of effecting it. Besides, it was not to be doubted that, by making them the communications and overtures we were authorized to do, many good consequences would result therefrom, and an important object of Government be effected, even if those Indians should not come down and treat with us. We should not, however, have been able to accomplish these objects had not Lieutenant Kennedy, (one of the disbanded officers equally distinguished by his bravery and enterprise,) seeing the utter impossibility of our procuring any other person, voluntarily offered to go on this mission; in which, although he could not succeed to the extent of our wishes, in consequence of his having his horses stolen from him, his services were, notwithstanding, very important; and he succeeded in sending talks by Indians whom he met with to those he could not visit. The Indians whe had been hostile to our Government generally manifested an evident backwardness to negotiate with us; attempted to temporize in every possible way, without committing themselves too far; and particularly by promising, but delaying, to send forward deputations to treat with us, and by sending incompetent deputations: in which conduct, we have many reasons for believing that they were influenced by unprincipled British traders, who endeavored to dissuade them from coming to the treaty; represented our invitations as insidious attempts to decoy them into our power, that we might massacre them; induced them to believe that Michilimackinac would never be surrendered, and that the war between the United States and Great Britain would shortly thereafter be renewed. Knowing that the Indians had, in several instances, and in a late one in particular, refused to comply with their treaties, because, as they alleged, those who made them had not competent power to bind the tribes to which they belonged, we felt it our duty to inquire particularly whether the tribes with whom we proposed to treat were properly represented; and, in some instances, we had to send back Indians of different tribes for more competent deputations; in all of which cases, however, the Indians, interpreters, and agents admitted that those tribes were not sufficiently represented. Owing to the disappointments and difficulties that have already been explained, we have constantly had under our charge more or less Indians from the commencement of the treaty till the 30th ultimo, when we sent off about one hundred and twenty-five, being all that then remained. The delays that have necessarily intervened (otherwise so much to be regretted) have certainly been productive of three of the most important treaties that we have made, viz: those with the Foxes, the Kickapoos, and loways, which could not have been effected upon the same terms at the commencement of the treaty, nor for some time thereafter. Those treaties, with all others that we have concluded, have been mentioned in our former communications, and are herewith transmitted. According to our instructions, we confined those treaties to the sole object of peace; but the Indians were in several instances extremely solicitous that they should also have embraced other subjects; and some further negotiation with some of them seems to be recommended by every dictate of policy. The Piankeshaws are extremely anxious to reside in this Territory, and wish to be permitted to sell the small tract of land which they own in the Illinois Territory, near the Wabash, for ploughs, horses, farming utensils, &c., which are necessary to enable them to make a new establishment. The loways are very desirous of coming more closely under the protection of the United States, and, for that purpose, wish to cede a part of their lands in order to obtain annuities, like the rest of the neighboring Indians. As this is a spontaneous offer on their part, and as the land would be a valuable acquisition on many accounts, and particularly so in the event of future hostilities, it might be very advisable to accede to their proposition. The Pattawatamies now occupy and assert a right to the land on the Illinois river which is contained in the. cession made by the Sacs and Foxes in 1804, and it is certainly to be apprehended that, without some adjustment of the dispute, the surveyors appointed to survey the military land within the Illinois Territory will meet with some serious opposition. The Chippewas, Menomonies, and Winnebagoes, who were all invited to send deputations to meet us at Portage des Sioux, did not send a single man, nor assign any reason for their not doing so. The Sacs of Rock river not only most explicitly refused to treat with us, but manifested without disguise their opposition to the views of our Government, and committed many of the most wanton depredations upon the frontier, even after the treaty commenced. Their conduct has been so outrageous and improper, that, for the sake of example to others, and to produce a proper respect for our Government, good policy requires that they should be compelled to make some retribution at least; and if it shall be thought proper that our duties shall be resumed in relation to them, we should indeed be very desirous of some particular instructions upon the subject. The Indians about Prairie du Chien are represented by Mr. Boilvin (the agent at that place) and several other persons who have lately returned from there as being in a state of the greatest commotion, occasioned by their divisions with regard to peace with the United States; all of which, together with the conduct of the Sacs, and the failure of the Winnebagoes, Menomonies, and Chippewas to meet us, is thought by the most intelligent white men who have been in that country, as well as by some of the most respectable friendly Indians, to be the result of the immense presents which the British Government have lately distributed, and the constant intrigues of British traders, who certainly have a greater quantity of merchandise on the Mississippi at present than they have ever had in any former year; indeed, from accounts from various quarters, it appears that they are making the greatest possible efforts to retain their influence over the Indians, and to engross the whole of their trade. Lieutenant Kennerly informs us that, while among the Indians of the Missouri, he received information that British traders were among the Mandans, where it was supposed they were making an establishment, as they had invited the Sioux to visit them at that place. This establishment is doubtless to be supplied from Hudson’s bay, or by the Northwest Company of Canada, and, if permitted to mature itself, will enable them to engross the whole of the trade of the upper parts of the Missouri river; while equal exertions will be made by them to draw the trade of the upper parts of the Mississippi down the Red river of Lake Winnipeg, between which rivers the portage is very inconsiderable, and communication easy. Having treated with a part of the Indians above Prairie du Chien, it might be desirable, for the purpose of removing all jealousies (too easily excited among them at any time) and cultivating a good understanding witli them, to treat with the rest; but that in the present year is totally impracticable. On our first meeting our attention was confined exclusively to those Indians who had been engaged in the war against us. We, however, afterwards had the honor to receive a letter from the Hon. A. J. Dallas, of 11th of June last, which, with its enclosures, enlarged our powers, and directed our attention to new objects, which have occupied a considerable portion of our time. In conformity to our latter instructions, we endeavored to keep ourselves constantly informed of the dispositions and intentions of the Indians, and the conduct of the British traders among them; the general result of which is already communicated. We also gave invitations to and were visited by several of the tribes who had remained firm in the interest of the United States, the good consequences of which were very apparent; and, indeed, if we had not been authorized to do so, the jealousies and discontents of those tribes would have been great and serious. The Shawanees and Delawares of this Territory made known to us at Portage des Sioux certain grievances of which they complain, in talks delivered by two of their principal chiefs, which at their request we have the honor herewith to transmit for the information of the President. It not having been made our particular duty to investigate the causes of complaint as alleged by them, we can only say that, as at present advised, we think them well founded; and being well acquainted with the uncommon sobriety and general good conduct of those Indians, the attachment which they have evinced towards our Government, their confidence in its justice, the alacrity with which they afforded their co-operation with us in lifts late war, the progress of civilization among them, &.C., we feel it our duty to recommend them to the benevolence as well as to the justice of our Government. The Cherokees of Arkansas complain bitterly of the intrusion of the white people, who, they say, destroy their game, settle among them without their consent, and act in such a manner as to produce disorders, discord, and confusion. Those Indians wish a certain tract of country to be assigned them, its bounds to be ascertained, and that the most efficient measures may be taken to prevent our own citizens from mixing with them, or otherwise intruding upon their lands.	v We have the honor to be, very respectfully, &c.	WILLIAM CLARK, NINIAN EDWARDS, AUG. CHOUTEAU. Talks. It is thirty years since we came to this country; when we arrived, the Spaniards told us to look for a suitable piece of ground to settle ourselves; after we found the said above-mentioned place, we informed the Spanish officer of it, and that we intended to settle ourselves. After we were settled, the commanding officer told us to remain at peace, hunt quietly, not to steal horses, nor go to war with any other nations. The Spanish commander told us that we might occupy the space of land between the river Cape St. Come and to the first creek above Cape Girardeau: this is what the Spaniards told us. Afterwards the Spaniards went away, and the Americans took possession of this country. Soon after we went and visited the American commander, who made us the same recommendations, and gave us the same advice we bad before beard from the Spaniards, and that we should experience no difference, and that we should be as happy with them as we had been with the Spaniards. We were very much pleased. After the council we held with the Americans, we returned home, and told our warriors and young men that their speech was just the same we had understood from the Spaniards. Governor Clark, my father, since three or four years we are very much crowded by the whites, who steal our horses and many other things, but yet it has not made us angry, hoping that the American Government will do us justice and take pity on our situation. Now that the commissioners are assembled to settle all matters with different tribes, we take this opportunity to lay under your consideration our present situation, and hope you will do all in your power to see us righted. My fathers, it is all I have to say, and beg of you to inform the President of the United States of our state and situation. WABEPELATIIV.—When the Spaniards told us to choose a piece of land, and that we had made choice of it, we obtained from them a grant, which has been since recorded by the board of commissioners, and we understand that all the concessions granted to the whites by the Spaniards were all good, and we expected ours would be so too. We live amongst the whites, and our behavior has been such that no honest white man can have any cause to find fault with us, and we are certain they will never have any cause to complain of us hereafter. We have always conducted ourselves honestly, and intend to continue so. Early in the spring, on my return from hunting, I found my house that had been broken open, and what I had left in it was all gone. I then took the resolution of moving to another place on the river Castor, to settle myself, provided my father Governor Clark would be pleased of my doing so. He recommended to us to raise stock and cultivate our land with industry, and his advice we have followed, and wish to remain at this new settlement if we can be permitted so to do, and do not care any thing more for our old town; but again, lately, we have been encroached upon by a white family by the name of Jenkins, which we hope you will remove from those lands if we are permitted to remain on them. SIR:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, November 10, 1815. The letter signed by the commissioners, and dated St. Louis, October 18, together with the treaties made with the several tribes of Indians, were duly received. The Secretary of War has not yet returned to the city, but is daily expected. I am directed by the President to request that you will take the necessary measures for removing all white persons who have intruded and settled upon the lands of the Indians within the Missouri Territory; and should military aid be deemed necessary, you will call upon the officer commanding the United States troops in the military department No. 9, who has orders to comply with any requisition that you may make on him for that object. .	'It is believed that the Pattawatamies can have no well-founded claim to the lands ordered to be surveyed for the military bounty lands. As they'have, however, been in the habit of hunting on those grounds, and as the deprivation may be attended with some inconvenience to them, Governor Edwards has been authorized to give them two thousand dollars as a compensation. I have the honor to be, GEORGE GRAHAM, Chief Clerk. WILLIAM CLARK, Governor of Missouri Territory. GENTLEMEN:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, November 24, 1815. The letter of the honorable Ninian Edwards and Auguste Chouteau Esq. of the 29th ultimo has been received by mail. In concluding a peace with the Kanzas tribe of Indians, you have pursued the course adopted by the commissioners appointed to treat with the northern tribes. The hostilities of the various tribes inhabiting the country west of ihe Mississippi have been so general, that this course appears to be necessary, and is entirely approved by the President. The exertions which the United States have made to effect a general pacification with their Indian neighbors, pursuant to the stipulations of the treaty of Ghent, the refusal of the Sacs of Rock river to attend the negotiations set on foot by the President for that purpose, and the acts of hostilities which they have committed since they were notified to attend the American commissioners, would justify the infliction of the severest chastisement upon those savages. The President, however, always disposed to pursue the most liberal policy towards the Indian tribes within our territories, preferring their reclamation by peaceful measures to their punishment by the application of the military force of the nation, receives with pleasure the intimation that this tribe has manifested a disposition at this late hour to listen to the voice of reason and justice, and to return to the habits of peace and friendly intercourse with*the United States. You are therefore authorized and instructed to permit the deputation of Sacs to meet you at such time and place as shall be convenient to you, and proceed to adjust with them the conditions of peace agreeably to your general instructions. The surrender of all property stolen or plundered since they were notified to attend the commissioners of the United States may properly be required as preliminary to the permission to attend for the purpose of treating. In granting this permission, they ought to be distinctly informed that it is entirely the result of the clemency and humanity of the President towards them in particular, and of his general disposition to treat with liberality and equity all the Indian tribes within the limits of the United States whose conduct shall not render a different policy indispensable. Instructions upon the subject of the claim of the Winnebagoes will be communicated tu you in due time, if it shall be thought that they are necessary. I have the honor to be, WILLIAM H. CRAWFORD. Governors WILLIAM CLARK, NINIAN EDWARDS, and AUGUSTE CHOUTEAU, Esq. A treaty between the United States of America and the Wyandot, Delaware, Seneca, Shawanee, Miami, Chippewa, Ottawa, and Pattawatamie tribes of Indians, residing within the limits of the State of Ohio and the Territories of Indiana and Michigan. Whereas the Chippewa, Ottawa, and Pattawatamie tribes of Indians, together with certain bands of the Wyandot, Delaware, Seneca, Shawanee, and Miami tribes, were associated with Great Britain in the late war between the United States and that Power, and have manifested a disposition to be restored to the relations of peace and amity with the said States; and the President of the United States having appointed William Henry Harrison, late a major general in the service of the United States; Duncan McArthur, late a brigadier in the service of the United States; and John Graham, esquire, as commissioners to treat with the said tribes; the said commissioners, and the sachems, headmen, and warriors of said tribes, having met in council at the Spring Wells, near the city of Detroit, have agreed to the following articles, which, when ratified by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States, shall be binding on them and the said tribes: ARTICLE 1. The United States give peace to the Chippewa, Ottawa, and Pattawatamie tribes. ART. 2. They also agree to restore to the said Chippewa, Ottawa, and Pattawatamie tribes all the possessions, rights, and privileges which they enjoyed or were entitled to in the year one thousand eight hundred and eleven, prior to the commencement of the late war with Great Britain; and the said tribes, upon their part, agree again to place themselves under the protection of the United States, and of no other Power whatsoever. ART. 3. In consideration of the fidelity to the United States which has been manifested by the Wyandot, Delaware, Seneca, and Shawanee tribes, throughout the late war, and of the repentance of the Miami tribe, as manifested by placing themselves under the protection of the United States by the treaty of Greenville, in eighteen hundred and fourteen, the said States agree to pardon such of the chiefs and warriors of said tribes as may have continued hostilities against them until the close of the war with Great Britain, and to permit the chiefs of their respective tribes to restore them to the stations and property which they held previously to the war. ART. 4. The United States and the before-mentioned tribes or nations of Indians, (that is to say, the Wyandot, Delaware, Seneca, Shawanee, Miami, Chippewa, Ottawa, and Pattawatamie,) agree to renew and confirm the treaty of Greenville, made in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, and all subsequent treaties to which they were respectively parties, and the same are hereby again ratified and confirmed in as full a manner as if they were inserted in this treaty. Done at Spring Wells, the eighth day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifteen, and of the independence of the United States the fortieth. In testimony whereof, they (the said commissioners, and the sachems, headmen, and warriors of the different tribes) have hereunto set their hands and affixed their seals. [Signed by the commissioneis of the United States and a number of Indian chiefs.] GENTLEMEN:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, June 9, 1815. The representations which the President has received from the State of Ohio, and the Territories of Michigan and Indiana, have rendered it expedient, in his judgment, to take immediate measures for removing the hostile excitement which has appeared; and he has been pleased to appoint you to be the commissioners of the United States for holding a treaty with such of the Indian tribes as it shall be deemed necessary to conciliate upon the occasion. You will, therefore, give the chiefs notice of your appointment, and that a meeting will be. held at Fort Wayne, or at any other place that may be more convenient, and at such time as may be fixed upon by the commissioners. The objects of the proposed treaty are, to remind the tribes of their existing relations with the United States; to explain to them the nature of the reciprocal stipulations in the treaty of peace and amity lately concluded between the United States and Great Britain, so far as they concern the Indians; to inform them of the measures that have been taken to carry the treaty of peace into effect, by a mutual surrender of the military posts which the American and the British forces had taken from each other during the war; to warn them against any improper practices that might involve them in hostilities with the United States; to promise a punctual performance uf all our engagements with them; and to insist upon the observance of good faith on their part. When the treaty with Great Britain was ratified at Washington, the United States were at war with some of the Indian tribes, and at peace with others. By the ninth article of the treaty, the parties reciprocally engaged to put an end to hostilities with all the tribes or nations with whom they were respectively at war; and, in fulfilment of this engagement, the United States appointed commissioners for the single purpose of offering a treaty of peace to all the Indian tribes on the Mississippi and its waters with whom they were at war at the time of fhe ratification of the treaty. But the United States were at that time in a state of peace and friendship with the tribes inhabiting the State of Ohio and the Territories of Michigan and Indiana; and had, in particular, concluded a treaty at Greenville, on the 22d July, 1814, with the Wyandots, Delawares, Shawanees, Senecas, and Miamies. The ninth article of the treaty with Great Britain did not, therefore, apply to those tribes; and the fact that peace was re-established between the United Statesand Great Britain being generally communicated and known throughout the Indian country, no act connected with the British treaty appeared to be necessary upon the part of the American Government to preserve peace, where peace already existed. It was also presumed that the British officers and agents would themselves communicate the return of peace to all the Indians in arms against them. There is reason to believe, however, that these grounds of distinction have not been understood by the Indians, and you will be pleased to take particular pains in explaining the conduct of the Government, so as to satisfy them that it has not neglected them or their interest. It will be proper that you should distinctly represent to the Indians that, on the present occasion, the United States do not wish to obtain from them any new cession, grant, or privilege whatsoever, but merely to manifest their disposition to cultivate peace and good-will, and to secure to themselves the advantages of the treaties which already exist. Where the United States have already purchased and paid for cessions of land or privileges uf roads, the tribes from which they were purchased must of course comply with their contracts; and, particularly, they must not, on any pretence, attempt to prevent or obstruct the necessary surveys for ascertaining the boundaries of the ceded tracts, and laying oot the stipulated roads. The President will in all things set them an example of good faith; and you may assure them he will take every occasion to promote their happiness and prosperity, as long as they shall show a just confidence in his word, and a friendly disposition towards the children of the American family who are placed under his care and protection in their neighborhood. The President entertains a strong hope that the Government of Great Britain will evince the sincerity with which it ratified the treaty of Ghent by restraining all its subjects from lawless attempts to alienate'the Indians from the nation whose territory they inhabit. But every precaution ought still to be taken to detect and defeat such attempts. The right of British traders to enter the territory of the United States for the purpose of trading with the Indians is a proper subject for the consideration of the American Government; but the Government has not yet prohibited a fair and friendly intercourse of that nature, and the President is only desirous at present to impress upon the Indians that the intercourse is entirely a matter of indulgence, which may be denied whenever it is found prejudicial to the interests of the United States. The Indians should be warned against any misrepresentation of the late treaty with Great Britain, which there is some reason to think has already been misrepresented. The stipulations respecting the Indians are reciprocal, and amount, in fact, to nothing more than would have been the case if the treaty had not contained them; they merely provide that the parties, as a consequence of the peace between themselves, shall severally offer peace to the Indians with whom they were actually at war when the treaty was ratified—each party agreeing with the other to place the Indians inhabiting their respective territories upon the footing upon which they stood before the war. In doing this, the United States have acted voluntarily; and it must not be credited for a moment that Great Britain has had any peculiar agency in obtaining a benefit for the Indian tribes, whether they were at war or at peace with us. It will be of some importance also to explain the reason which has prevented the immediate surrender of Michilimackinac. The British troops have evacuated Castine, Fort Niagara, and Fort Bowyer, and they are preparing to evacuate Michilimackinac; but as their buildings on the shore of Lake Huron were burnt during the war, the British chargé d’affaires has requested that the troops might be permitted to remain where they are until a shelter can be provided for them within their own territory. The President, in a spirit of friendly accommodation, has acquiesced in the request, upon an assurance that the postponement of the surrender would not be unreasonably protracted. In the mean time orders have been issued for the surrender of Malden, provided it can be done without danger from Indian hostilities, before the surrender of Michilimackinac is effected. The object of these explanations will be to counteract any suppositions that the treaty of peace has placed Great Britain in a new and more advantageous relation to the Northwest Indians; to supersede the idea that the Indians have acquired by the treaty a more independent political character than they possessed before; and to beget a just confidence in the power as well as the resolution of our Government to maintain its rights against every opposition. The policy of introducing military stations and factories generally into the Indian country becomes every day more and more apparent, as well for the sake of the Indians as for our own sake. An opportunity should be taken, therefore, to apprize the Indians that, in order to aid and protect them, and also to guard against encroachments upon the property and people of the United States, the President contemplates ordering a chain of establishments to be gradually extended from Chicago, along the Illinois, to St. Louis. This will secure for them supplies; will afford them an occasional asylum; and will present constant opportunities either to claim redress for any grievances that they may suffer, or to communicate intelligence of any dangers that they may apprehend at home or abroad. It is, indeed, particularly important that they should be taught a habit of giving to the public agents constant information of any occurrences that concern the peace and the safety of the country. A short time before the treaty of Ghent was ratified, a quantity of goods had been sent to the care of Governor Cass, for presents to such of the Indians as were willing to take an active part in the war. The design was merely gratuitous; and, the occasion for making the presents having ceased, it is believed that the goods remain undistributed. If this be the case, and you should think it advisable and serviceable to distribute any part of them among the Indians on the present occasion, you may apply to Governor Cass, who will receive instructions to execute any requisition that you shall make. The President will be desirous to bear the accounts of your progress, and of your prospect of success, as often as you can transmit them; and the result of your negotiations, if it is such as may be reasonably expected, you will put into the form of a treaty, recognising'the existing state of peace, exchanging assurances of mutual friendship, and confirming all antecedent treaties and engagements, except so far as they respect a co-operation in the late war against Great Britain. The compensation of the commissioners and their secretary upon the present occasion will be the same as was allowed for the services of the commissioners at the treaty of Greenville, in July, 1814; and the contractor will be directed to furnish the necessary supplies upon your requisition, to be deposited at such place and time as you shall desire. You will appoint your own secretary, selecting him (if you can advantageously) from the number of meritorious officers who are not retained on the military peace establishment. If you should deem a military escort necessary to the safety of the commissioners, you will be pleased to apply to the officer commanding the American troops in the department, who will receive orders to grant your request. I have the honor to be, &c. A. J. DALLAS. To Major General WM. H. HARRISON, Brigadier General DUNCAN MCARTHUR, and JOHN GRAHAM, Esq. SIR:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, June 12, 1815. Agreeably to the intimation which was given in my letter of the — instant, the President has appointed Governor William H. Harrison, General Duncan McArthur, and Mr. John Graham, to hold a treaty with the Northwest Indians at Fort Wayne, in the Indiana Territory, at such time as they shall appoint. The President relies upon your good offices in preparing the Indians for the proposed council, and in bringing it to an amicable termination. He has directed me to communicate to you (in confidence) a copy of the instructions which have been sent to the commissioners, that you may see at once the principles upon which your co-operation is desired, and may be rendered the most efficient. I have, the honor to be, &c. A. J. DALLAS. Governor WORTHINGTON, of the State of Ohio. Governor CASS, of the Michigan Territory. SIR:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, June 12, 1815. My letter of this date informs you that Governor Harrison, General McArthur, and Mr. John Graham are appointed commissioners to hold a treaty with the Northwest Indians. If the goods which were sent to your care a short time before the termination of the war for the purpose of making presents to such of the Indians as should take an active part in our favor have not been distributed, the commissioners are authorized to make a requisition upon you for the-whole or a part of the goods, to use at the proposed treaty. You will be pleased, therefore, to transmit to them an invoice of the articles, and to comply with their requisition, with as much despatch as is practicable. A copy of the invoice, of the requisition, and of the receipt for the delivery, you will be pleased to send to this Department. If a requisition should not be made by the commissioners, you will consider the former instructions respecting the disposition of these goods to be still in force. *	I am, very respectfully, &c. A. J. DALLAS. LEWIS CASS, Governor of the Michigan Territory. GENTLEMEN:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, June 16, 1815. It has been represented to the President of the United States that, during the march to Detroit, a number of cattle and hogs, and a quantity of grain belonging to the Indians, were taken, or used, or damaged by our troops. The President requests that you will examine and ascertain the facts; and he authorizes you to assume, on behalf of the United States, the payment of a fair valuation of the property in question. I take this opportunity to enforce your general instructions respecting rights already acquired from the Indians by treaty. The act of Congress requires two millions of acres of land in the Michigan Territory to be surveyed and appropriated for the land bounty allowed by law to the army. You will apprize the Indians of an intention to make the surveys immediately, and secure their acquiescence.	- Your commission to treat with the Indians has been transmitted under an envelope to Governor Harrison, the first named commissioner. I am, very respectfully, A. J. DALLAS. Gov. HARRISON, Gen. MCARTHUR, and JOHN GRAHAM, Esq. SIR:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, July 12, 1815. In the absence of the Acting Secretary of War, I have been requested by the President to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ult., and to forward you a copy of your instructions, lest the original, which was directed to you at Vincennes, may not have been received. From these instructions, you will observe that it is not contemplated to obtain a cession of land from, the Indians at the treaty which you are authorized to hold with them, but that its objects are merely those of peace and good-will, and to obtain the fulfilment of all treaties that have heretofore been entered into. You will also perceive that the time of holding the treaty is left altogether to the discretion of the commissioners; and I am requested by the President to say that, if the preliminary measures which you propose as the means of impressing the Indians with more favorable dispositions towards us, and of inducing, the tribes more generally to attend the grand council, are concurred in by the gentlemen acting with you in the commission, you are at liberty to pursue them. It is, however, desirable that the treaty should be held at as early a period as may be compatible with the attainment of the objects contemplated; and it is hoped here that the evacuation of the western posts by the British forces will have so powerful an effect as to induce them to seek an early and satisfactory termination of all differences with us.	'I have the honor to be, GEORGE GRAHAM, Chief Clerk. Maj. Gen. WM. H. HARRISON, near Cincinnati. GENTLEMEN:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, August 7, 1815. At the request of the Acting Secretary of War, I enclose for your information a copy of a letter received from Governor Cass, dated the 7th ultimo. The goods forwarded to Detroit, it is presumed, will be sufficient as well for the purposes of the treaty as for those contemplated by Governor Cass. Mr. Dallas has not deemed it necessary to give any additional instructions to those which you have already. He has approved of the measures proposed by Governor Cass for running the line, and authorized him to call out a company of rangers to attend the surveyors, if necessary. I have the honor to be, &c. GEORGE GRAHAM, Chief Clerk. Gen. WM. H. HARRISON, Gen. MCARTHUR, JOHN GRAHAM, Commissioners. SIR:	DETROIT, August 26, 1815. Having been appointed by the President of the United States commissioners for treating with certain Indian tribes inhabiting the territories of the United States, we, immediately on our arrival here, gave notice to the chiefs assembled at this place of our wish to meet in council all the Indians belonging to those tribes who had taken part in the late war against us, (some of whom, as we are informed, still remain in the territories of His Britannic Majesty,) that we might inform them of the provisions in the treaty of Ghent, so far as they were interested, and concert with them the proper measures for carrying the same into effect. We accordingly requested the chiefs of their respective tribes to invite them to meet us on the 25th of this month. This invitation did not produce the desired effect, and we were told in council that they were detained by the British agents for Indian affairs. Understanding that you have a general control over these agents, we have deemed it as due to the friendly relations of our two Governments to apprize you of the fact, not doubting that you will adopt such measures as may seem to you most proper to give full effect to the ninth article of the treaty of Ghent, which, you are aware, requires certain acts on the part of the Indians to whom it applies. Our secretary, Major Langham, will have the honor to deliver you this, and will receive your answer. We have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servants, WM. HENRY HARRISON, DUNCAN MCARTHUR, JOHN GRAHAM. The Senior Officer Commanding, fyc. Malden. SIR:	AMHERSTBURGH, August 27, 1815. I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant. In answer to which I beg leave to inform you that the officer commanding at this post has no control or authority whatever over the Indians, they being considered as a free and independent people—consequently, at liberty to act for themselves. All matters relating to Indian affairs are conducted by officers appointed for the express purpose, at the head of whom is a deputy superintendent, to whom all communications respecting the Indians should be made. I have made every inquiry to ascertain if any regular communication had been received from you inviting the Indians to the council you say was directed to assemble on the 25th instant, but can only learn that private invitations had been received by individuals, who, it appears, had no objection to going over, but considered it a matter of greater importance their attending a council ordered to assemble here on the 26th instant for the explaining the articles of the treaty of Ghent. I cannot account for the conduct of the person who delivered me your letter, with whom I sent a servant to conduct him to the quarters of the deputy superintendent of Indian affairs; but on going part of the way he dismissed the servant, and, as far as I can learn, returned immediately to Detroit, taking the letter with him. I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient, humble servant, EDWARD BARRACK. Major General HARRISON, &C., Detroit. SIR:	AMHERSTBURGH, August 29, 1815. On my landing at Sandwich yesterday, a letter signed A. L. Langham was delivered to me by an interpreter of the United States Indian Department; and the singular circumstances, altogether, on the visit of the writer to this post, and his interview with Major Barrack, induced me to defer a reply to your own letter of the 26th instant, and which I have now the honor to do. In regard to the first paragraph of your letter, I beg leave to inform you that the different tribes of Indians and their chiefs now resident in the British territory had been fully made acquainted with every article of the treaty of Ghent, and that their satisfaction at the same was manifest, and their conduct since orderly and peaceable.’ In regard to the second, I am induced to believe that no detention has taken place on the part of the British agents, or any inducement whatever held out to the Indians on this side of the river not to cross over to the councils which you speak of. In regard to the third, it is needless for me to inform you that the Indians are their own free agents, and are not to be forced to act beyond their own pleasure; and I again disavow all knowledge, or even belief, of the fact of their being prevented attending the councils you wished; and, also, that the treaty’of Ghent has been most fully explained to those Indians who had been in alliance with this Government. It may be necessary for me to remark to you, sir, that I am not at all surprised at any disinclination on the part of the Indians on the left bank of these lakes and rivers to visit the opposite shores, when such pains had so very recently (to my own knowledge) been taken to prohibit one of them ever to pass over; and to this line of conduct alone do I attribute their not attending your councils, and not to the reasons which you are pleased to assign. I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient, humble servant, WM. JAMES, Lieutenant Colonel Commanding. To Major General HARRISON, &c., Detroit. Sin:	-	DETROIT, August 30, 1815. The letter which you did me the honor to address to me yesterday, in answer to that of my colleagues and myself of the 26th instant, was delivered last evening. In reply to that part of your letter which relates to Major Langham, I must be permitted to believe that a knowledge of all the “ circumstances” attendant on his visit to Amherstburgh would have freed his conduct at least from the imputation of “ singularity.” The major, having been furnished with a conveyance by water, reached Amherstburgh late in the evening. It was his first object to procure quarters, but finding, upon inquiry, that all the public houses were full, he was under the necessity of waiting immediately upon the commanding officer, although he previously understood that he was engaged with company. Upon his delivering the letter to Major Barrack, after a hasty perusal of it, the major returned it, and informed him-that a Colonel Caldwell was the person to whom the letter should have been delivered, and a servant was sent to conduct Major Langham to his residence. It was not until he advanced some distance that it occurred to Major L. that it could not have been the intention of the commissioners that their letter should be delivered to any other person than the military commandant to whom it was directed. Being unable to procure accommodations and refreshment in the public houses for himself and his men, the sun being nearly down, and being unwilling again to intrude on Major Barrack, he thought it proper to set out immediately on his return to this place. The commissioners approve of his refusing to deliver the letter to Colonel Caldwell, and directed him to return it to Major Barrack by any conveyance that might offer. None having occurred for some hours, an interpreter was charged with its delivery. After the departure of the interpreter, the letter of Major Barrack of the 27th was received. From the answer of Major Barrack to the letter of the commissioners, it appears that he had a very imperfect recollection of the contents of the letter. It was certainly never our intention to apply to a British officer to use any “ control or authority” over the Indians to induce them to attend the council to which they had been invited. Our letter contains nothing that could warrant this idea; it was simply a communication of the information which had been conveyed to us, that an officer of the Indian department had exerted his “ authority” to prevent their attendance. It was doubtless incumbent on the two Governments to cause the article in the treaty of Ghent that relates to the. Indian tribes which were respectively employed by them in the late war to be properly explained to them. I receive with pleasure the information you convey that this has been done on the part of His Britannic Majesty, that they have, expressed their “ satisfaction” at it, and promisejn future to be “ orderly and peaceable.” It is much to be regretted, however, that this was not sooner done, as it might have been the means of preventing those depredations upon the property of our citizens, so vexatious and injurious to them as well as troublesome to you, and which I have understood have been continued until a very few days past. Front his excellency Governor Cass I have been informed that the restrictions upon the Indians passing the strait, to which you refer in the close of your letter, was in consequence of those depredations, but that it was never intended to prohibit the crossing of the Indians at this place. I have tho honor to be, sir, your obedient servant, WM. HENRY HARRISON. Lieutenant Colonel JAMES, Commanding, fyc., Amherstburgh. Stn:	DETROIT, September 9, 1815. Wc have the honor to inform you that we yesterday concluded and signed a treaty with the sachems, headmen, and warriors of the Wyandot, Delaware, Shawanee, Seneca, Ottawa, Chippewa, Pattawatamie, and Miami tribes of Indians. One copy of this treaty will be delivered to you by Mr. Graham, the other has been deposited with Tarhee, (or the Crane,) the principal chief of the Wyandots. Although our instructions did not render it necessary, yet we deemed it proper to include in this treaty as well those tribes who had been friendly to us as those who had been hostile: 1st. Because many individuals belonging to the friendly tribes had taken up arms against the United States, and could only in this way be fully restored to their former situation; 2d. Because these tribes wished and expected to be included in the treaty. We hope that the President will approve this course, and that the several articles of the treaty will be satisfactory to him. We found no difficulty in prevailing on the Indians to agree to renew and confirm all former treaties, and again to acknowledge themselves under the protection of the United States, and of no other Power. The Prophet, and most of those who were immediately connected with him, left the council and retired to the British territory before the treaty was signed. They professed, however, in open council, before they went away, the most pacific intentions, and declared that they would adhere to any treaty made by the chiefs who remained. We had at the council a very full representation of all the tribes who are parties to the treaty, and we have every reason to believe that they will adhere to it as strictly as they ever have adhered to any former treaty with us, unless the British agents should interfere to prevent it. The Wyandots are much dissatisfied that the road from the Rapids of the Miami to the western line of the Connecticut Reserve has been laid off so as to cross the Sandusky river at the Seneca village, instead of crossing at Lower Sandusky. They say that the road, running as it is laid out, will injuriously interfere with the settlement of the Senecas, to whom they granted the lands on that part of the Sandusky many years before the treaty of Brownstown was made; and that their understanding of the treaty was, that the road was to run from the Rapids of the Miami to the reserved tract at Sandusky. It is their wish that the road should now take that direction, but they are willing that it should strike the Sandusky anywhere between the reservation and an old Indian path that strikes the river about three miles below the fort. Fully persuaded, from all the information we have received, that a much better road may be got in this way than that marked by the commissioners, we have written to the surveyor general, informing him of our having agreed with the Wyandot chiefs that it should be so run. The chiefs complained to us that our citizens were constantly trespassing upon their lands, some of them having commenced considerable farms, without their approbation, while many more employed themselves in hunting and destroying the animals which were so necessary to them, and which, indeed, afforded the only support to their families. We found, upon inquiry, that this complaint was not without foundation, and we did not hesitate to promise the Indians that decisive measures would be taken tu redress them. We are induced to believe that a proclamation of the President, printed and distributed along the frontiers, would have the desired effect. It is unnecessary that we should say any thing to you, sir, of the importance of giving the Indians an example of good faith by the strictest fulfdment of every engagement we make with them. Good policy, as well as justice, requires this, as a contrary conduct would have the effect of procrastinating a further extinction of title to lands, which is now so ardently desired by the citizens uf Ohio. The subject of compensation to the Indians who remained faithful to us during the war, for property destroyed by our troops, has engaged our attention. There exists considerable difficulty in adjusting some of their accounts, from the difficulty of obtaining proper proof; and it appeared that the words of your instructions did not embrace some descriptions of property, the loss of which could be easily ascertained, as the remuneration appeared to be just and reasonable. Believing that it was within the spirit of your instructions, we have therefore agreed to include the horses that were clearly ascertained to have been stolen by our people, and to compensate the Seneca tribe for their houses which were wantonly burnt by our militia. We had less difficulty as to the former of these items, because payment, under such circumstances, is guarantied by existing treaties; and on the latter, because they were promised compensation by General Harrison at the time when the destruction of the bouses took place. As we are unable to close the accounts here for the want of the testimony of Messrs. Johnston and Stickney, Indian agents, it has been agreed that General Harrison should undertake the adjustment of the accounts of the Shawanee tribe at Piqua, on his return, and General McArthur those of the Wyandots and Senecas at Sandusky. Illness has prevented General McArthur from signing this letter. We have the honor to be, with great respect, sir, your humble servants, WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON. JOHN GRAHAM. Hon. W. H. CRAWFORD, Secretary of liar. Journal of the proceedings of the commissioners appointed to treat with the Northwest Indians at Detroit. CHILICOTHE, OHIO, August 8,1815. General McArthur and John Graham, esquire, two of the commissioners, met, and appointed Angus L. Langham their secretary. August 11, 1815.—Proceeded on their journey to Detroit. August 15.—Met General Harrison at Upper Sandusky. DETROIT, August 22. The commissioners held a preliminary meeting with part of the Wyandot, Ottawa, Chippewa, and Pattawata- mie tribes. General Harrison, on behalf of his colleagues.—He saluted his red brothers, the chiefs, in the name of the President of the United States. He thanked the Great Spirit that they were again permitted to meet, and to talk of peace and friendship. A treaty had been concluded between the American and British nations, an evidence of which was presented to the Indians in the friendly intercourse which subsisted at this time between them. In that treaty it was stipulated that peace should be offered to the hostile Indians on both sides for their acceptance. In obedience to that stipulation, and to the affection which the President felt for his red children, he had sent the commissioners not only to bury the tomahawk, and the animosity which the late contest had excited, but also its remembrance. He wished to offer peace to all the tribes included within the limits of the United States, and all the members of those tribes, who had joined the British in the late war, and wished them all to come, and hear the good words of the President, sent through the commissioners to them. For that purpose, as all of them had not yet assembled, he appointed the 25th for the day on which they should kindle the council fire at the Spring Wells, at which he invited them all to attend, and to send word to all the absent members of their tribes, as well those on the other side of the river with the British as those on this side, promising that they should be received with friendship, entertained in safety, and might return if they chose in peace. It had been reported to the commissioners that evil birds had been hovering about them, whispering in their ears that they were to be assembled here on the pretext of peace only to be betrayed and destroyed; that General Brown, the great war chief of the United States, (whom they then saw on his left hand,) and his warriors, were assembled here for that purpose, and other stories of that description, which the red coats had the disposition and capacity to invent. He would not condescend to controvert an imputation so foul and false. The conduct of the United States towards them they all knew, and he invited any person in the assembly to produce an instance, during their long intercourse with the United States, where they had once acted treacherously towards them. It was the wish of the commissioners (as none of the Shawanee chiefs were present) to make known to (the Prophet) and all the Indians who were now with the British at Malden, &c., that they should be met with friendship at the council fire, but they forbade any entreaties on their part to be used. To them the path to the council fire should be open and safe; they might come or stay, at their option. If they came, they should be treated as friends. The citizens of Detroit had during the war been harassed and despoiled of their property. It would be too hard if the return of peace brought with it no security or protection to them or their property. They - therefore most solemnly enjoined on them to respect the property of the inhabitants, and to abstain from excesses. The Bay, a Pattawatamie chief.—Brothers, I salute you. I rejoice’to hear the kind words which, in his goodness, our father has sent to his red children. I rejoice that the tomahawk, stained with blood, will be laid on the earth, never, I hope, to be raised again. All the red children rejoice with me at the prospect of again treading their wilderness, and pursuing their game in peace and security. 3 E We will comply with your request by restraining our young men from committing depredations on the property of the citizens. We both have some bad men, who act improperly. We will endeavor to restrain them. What can be done, we will do.	> Father, I particularly rejoice to meet you again iu council and in peace. SPRING WELLS, August 25, 1815. The commissioners met the chiefs of the Wyandot, Seneca, Ottawa, Chippewa, and Pattawatamie tribes. As many tribes which were, expected soon had not arrived, the commissioners informed the tribes present that the lighting of the council fire would be delayed until Monday, the 28th. They expressed a wish, if they had received any answer from the Indians on the other side of the river to the invitation to attend the council, to hear it. Tar-hee, (or the. Crane,) chief of the Wyandots.—He would inform his brothers and friends of the result of the message sent to the other side of the river. The message was sent by his nephew, who was met by one of the Wyandots, who bore it to Walk-in-the-Water. Walk-in-the-Water being sick, and unable to be the bearer himself, sent one of his tribe. The messenger went to the other side, and found the Indians in council with thé British agents, and delivered the message to the Wyandots. He was answered by one of the British agents, saying that they had received a message from the other side of the great waters, commanding them to hold a council at the same time that the American council should be held; that the young men who were in the habit of passing from one side to the other might attend (if they chose) the American council, but they could not spare the chiefs until their council should be over; them they wanted near their council fire, as they were convinced that their council would involve more of the interests, and be more to the advantage of the Indians, than the American council. The agent further observed that they might attend the American council after they had attended theirs. [The above was interpreted to the other Indians by Captain Knaggs.] Mis-col-no-mie, for the Mad Sturgeon,) a Pattawatamie.—He sent by a Kickapoo the message to the Prophet, requesting him to come to this side and attend the council, and bring with him two chiefs of each tribe, to inform them of the truth of a complaint which had been made that the British did nut issue rations sufficient. The Prophet answered that he could not come to this side until the council was terminated; after this council was terminated, he would come over and explain to them his opinions and his conduct. General Harrison.—He discovered that the answers received were not the answers of the Indians, but of the British agents. Why they should prevent or procrastinate a treaty of peace with the Indians, he could not perceive, as it was expressly for the purpose of fulfilling a treaty with themselves; that treaty he held in his hand, an article of which expressly declared that peace should be offered to the Indians who had fought against either party. The object of the United States was to preserve peace. This wish of theirs for peace did not proceed from a dread of war. All the Indians had experienced their bravery in the field. Nations, in their armorial bearing, had appropriated to themselves the emblem of some animal whose character they admired and wished to imitate. The Americans had taken the eagle, (the king of birds,) holding in one claw the green branch, (the emblem of peace,) in the other the arrows, (the emblem of war.) These arrows had been used with success against Great Britain; they were used until she manifested a disposition for peace. He held iu his hand the result of that disposition—a treaty of peace. In all his communications with them, he had made them acquainted with what was doing on the other side of the great waters. An event had lately occurred there, which, with the approbation of his colleagues, he would recite to them.'At the time that peace was made between the United States and Great Britain, all the world was at peace; since which time war has again commenced, by the French nation attempting to restore to their throne the great chief Bonaparte; but with the belligerents the United States are still at peace. In this last war, nine kings are arrayed against Bonaparte, at the head of whom is the King of Great Britain. These nine kings and some of the French people wish to restore Louis XVIII., another king whom the French had driven away. They have had three days of hard fighting. During two of these days Bonaparte partly defeated them, having driven them as far as from this place to the Maumee rapids. On the third day, however, we have reason to believe that Bonaparte was defeated, but it is probable that he had not suffered more than the allies had done, for they did not drive him farther than the position which be occupied the first day. The British say that they have heard more than we have, and that the French nation has dethroned Bonaparte, and restored Louis XVIII. It was false if it had been represented to the Indians that Great Britain alone maintained the contest against France. France was almost equal to all these nine kings; but a contest between France and any one of those kings would be like a fight between the eagle and the sparrow; France would crush them in a moment. With these European contests the Americans, as a nation, had nothing to do. These great events excited the interest and wishes of individuals, and individual opinion itself was divided—some wishing success to one side, some to the other; but as a nation they were not allied to either. Like the Indians, it is true that, being a nation of freemen, they had no regard for emperors or kings. The foregoing he recited merely as a subject of curiosity to them, and to remove the impression which was attempted to be made on them, that the fate of America was connected with that of Bonaparte. It had no connexion with the object of this council. A general maxim of the United States was, to consider and treat all the world as friends, unless they were at war. They wished it with the Indians, as well as the rest of the world; but, as they had been before told, they always gave the option of war or peace. Another maxim was to form no alliances with any of the European nations, being a strong and powerful nation, and capable of defending itself against all other nations. With the Indians, their neighbors, who with them inhabit the same continent, they particularly desired peace. This desire is evidenced by this circumstance, that the United States have never first commenced war against them: war has ever commenced from some one or other of their tribes. The Shawanees, Delawares, Wyandots, and Miamies were coming, and the Saginaws were expected: the council would adjourn until their arrival. A cannon fired from the fort would be a signal for them to assemble for council. Now-ge-sheck, (or 12 o'clock,) a Chippewa.—Brother Knaggs, I am going to interpret for my nation; do you interpret for me to my white father. We are rejoiced at the prospect of peace, which we infer from your words; we wish for peace, and are glad that we are so disposed. I hope and expect that we will grasp each other so firmly by the hand that we will never more separate. I have little to say at present; all our tribe are not here; when they are assembled you shall hear more; for the present, we want plenty of food. As the council is about to be adjourned for three nights, we wish our father to bare his breast; we want some milk; we also want to smoke. Ou-que-nog-sch, (or the Ugly Fellow,) Ottawa.—He spoke, the representative of three nations; the three considered themselves as one. They were glad that their father was willing to hear them; if he was willing to hear, they would ask for plenty to eat. The speech of the commissioners made him smile; it made his heart smile; but both his face and his heart would smile more if his belly was full. They also wanted a little whiskey to enable them to love their squaws more ardently. Ordered, That the Indians receive as much provisions as they want. DETROIT, August 26. The commissioners sent a communication to the commanding officer at Amherstburgh, copies of which, and of the correspondence which ensued, have been furnished to the Department. SPRING WELLS, August 28. General Harrison.—He discovered the same reasons for adjourning the council which existed before—the nonattendance of many of the tribes. The commissioners had received a communication from the other side of the river, in which they deny having interfered to prevent the Indians from attending this council, and that the object of assembling a council at Malden was precisely the same with this—to explain to the Indians the treaty of Ghent. It was to be regretted, as their object was the same, that they had fixed on the same time for holding their councils; but it was still probable that all the Indians who were now at Malden would also attend this council. He would explain to them again the object of the council. When the United States, or Seventeen Fires, and Great Britain, made peace, it was agreed and stipulated that both parties should offer peace to the Indian tribes who had raised the tomahawk against them; that the King of Great Britain should offer peace to those who had fought against his people on the side of the Americans; and that the President of the United States should offer peace to those who had fought against his people on the side of the British; that the Indians who were then at war should be restored to all their possessions and privileges which they enjoyed previous to the war. On these terms peace was to be offered and concluded, provided the Indians would accept peace on such terms: on such terms the President of the United States now extended the hand of peace; if they did not take hold of it, that part of the treaty of Ghent was at an end. If others should not come, the commissioners would make the treaty with those who were present, and forever exclude from its circle those who neglect or refuse to come and renew the chain which had united them to the American nation. SPRING WELLS, August 29, 1815. General Harrison observed that the same cause for postponement still presented itself—the non-assemblage of the tribes. This cause had operated so long on behalf of the commissioners that they had resolved to leave it to them (who were assembled) at what time the council fire should be lighted. He would inform them that the commissioners had just received a communication from the Prophet, in which he professes it to have been always his determination to attend this council, (the contrary had, however, been reported to him in council,) and that a deputation of two chiefs from each tribe of those on the other side of the river would also attend on this evening at —■ o’clock. He requested them to decide whether they should appoint to-morrow, or wait until the arrival of those chiefs from the other side, and jointly with them determine on the time for lighting the council fire. The great object of the council had been often explained; he would not again repeat it. There was another object, which was to ascertain what would be the conduct of the Indians who had been hostile to the United States towards the other tribes and towards the British. As the act of declaring war was performed after the manner of the Indians at Greenville last year, the commissioners would take the advice of their old friend the Crane, and have the ceremonies of making peace performed after the same manner. The commissioners had frequently explained their sentiments to them; they now wished the Indians to express their wishes, and give their advice as to the manner and time of performing these ceremonies. The commissioners could receive their answer now, or delay that gratification until to-morrow; if delayed, they requested those tribes that had some parts of them on the other side of the river to consult with them on the subject. After some deliberation among the tribes— The Crane.—As their father had left it to them to determine on the time for meeting their several tribes, the Wyandots, Pattawatamies, Chippewas, Ottawas, and their nephews, the Delawares, had determined that three nights should intervene, (making Friday.) On the day succeeding the intervening nights the council should be open. The reasons influencing this determination were, that the Shawanees had not arrived; that he understood they were very sickly, and that cause alone prevented their arrival; and further, with the approbation of the commissioners, they wished to send a messenger to the other side of the river, requesting them to come over speedily. General Harrison.—The commissioners accorded with the Indians as fo the time which they specified, but on that day they wished it to be definitely fixed. They cordially approved of their sending a messenger to the other side; they were unwilling to stand on a nice point of exactness with them; they wished them to come over and hear them, convinced that, after they heard the fair and honorable proposals which they were authorized to make, it would remove any prejudice which they might now entertain against the President of the United States and the American people. SPRING WELLS, August 31,1815. General Harrison.—This being the day appointed for lighting the council fire, the first ceremony to be performed would be to remove all difficulty and impediments to their sitting around our council fire. The Seventeen Fires had committed the performance of the ceremonies of the day to their oldest son, (the Crane,) chief of the Wyandots. The people of the United States were accustomed to liken his fidelity to them to the fidelity of the great archangel to his Creator. In war, as in peace, he had ever stood by the Seventeen Fires; and they request their red children to consider whatsoever he should say as coming directly from themselves. The Crane.—Brothers, I salute you all; I salute you from the bottom of my heart; I rejoice that I meet you here, and return thanks to the Great Spirit that we meet in peace. Hearken to me, who am about addressing you on behalf of the Seventeen Fires, and four tribes, the Wyandots, Delawares, Shawanees, and Senecas—tribes who have sided with the Seventeen Fires, and consider themselves as one with them. Listen to us, the four tribes; we speak in behalf of all the Seventeen Fires. You, brothers, who have been on the other side of the river, I address myself particularly to you. You appear to look dark, brothers, as you sit before me; your eyes are dimmed with tears, and you cannot see aright. We have had a quarrel—that quarrel has caused your sorrow. I must now proceed to clear your sight; I shall do so in the manner and language of our forefathers, in the language which the Great Spirit gave to them to heal their difficulties, and speak peace. Younger brothers—you, too, Wyandots, who have seceded from your tribe, and all you who have come from the other side of the river: In viewing you, you look sorrowful; you look sorrowful, not only from the operations of war, but also from sickness. This cause has not only operated on you, it has reached your women and children. This is the reason why your countenances are sad. You, brothers, nephews, and Wyandots, who have come from the other side of the river; you who are sad of heart, and blinded by tears: I take this wampum into my hand; the Great Spirit gave it to his red children to speak with; it was the language of our forefathers; with it, as the emblem of the softest and whitest cloth, I wipe your eyes, aud the eyes of your women and children, that you may all see clear again. Brothers, listen on. Listen to the Seventeen Firesand the four nations, speaking with one voice. I speak the language which the Great Spirit permits. The same cause which prevented you from seeing, prevents you from hearing. I now take the emblem of the softest and finest feather, and clear your ears, that the words of your brothers, the Americans, may penetrate your ears, and sink deeply into your hearts. Your throats, too, have been stopped; you could not speak the truth; you could not speak kindly to your brothers; with like affection, I will now clean your throat with the softest and whitest cloth. Your hearts, also, in consequence of the disorganization of your senses, have béen perverted; I now place them aright, that you may not only see, hear, and speak kindly to your brother Americans now, but in all times hereafter. Brothers, &c. who have been hostile: Listen on to the Seventeen Fires and the four nations, speaking, &c. In consequence of the war and sickness which have raged, the bones of your friends are scattered over the earth; 1 will now gather them together, and deposite them in one grave, that your minds may be at rest hereafter. Brothers, listen on. I have said that I collect your bones; I now bury them, and smooth their graves, that posterity travelling over them may not, by observing the protuberance, remember their former animosities. Brothers, listen. I hope you will still attend to my words. I have collected and buried the bones of your deceased friends, and I have smoothed their graves; I have done so by the emblematic language which the Great Spirit gave to his children. I now take into my hand (another wampum) a white board, and with it I cover the bones of your friends; this board the Great Spirit gave; the sun will not warm through it, nor can the rain wet through it; it will preserve the remains of your friends dry and secure. Brothers, listen—all listen to what we now speak. We speak in behalf of the Seventeen Fires, and of the four nations who have remained faithful to them; we have been addressing ourselves particularly to those who came from the other side of the river; but listen now all of you, that you may remember the ceremonies which now are performed. One bunch of wampum was to clear the eyes, unstop the ears, cleanse the throat, and amend the heart; another to collect the bones, to bury them, to smooth the graves, and to secure them by a board, which the sun could not warm, nor the rain moisten. These were all the ceremonies which would be performed, as the day was far advanced, and their father would have but little time to address them. General Harrison.—He, on behalf of the commissioners, particularly addressed the Prophet and the Shawanees, and all those who had taken up artps against the United States. He saluted them all, and desired to speak to them of times past. There was a time of dread and dismay, when darkness rested on the forest, when the warrior wandered in uncertainty and fear, often sleeping on the blood which covered his path, while his distant and anxious family (confined in their cabins) were looking frequently in vain for his return. At this period you were unfriended and hopeless; he who had stood at your back, and promised to support you, had deserted you. At this period our great chief (Wayne) called you together, and took you by the hand; he and you, in the presence of all the white and red people, raised a great tree, under which you buried the tomahawk which had so long been raised between us, and had so often been stained with our blood. Under the shade of this tree, for a long period of revolving years, the white and red people enjoyed as much happiness as falls to the lot of humanity. But, unfortunately for us all, some young men, more devoted to amusements than to useful pursuits, as they were dancing around this tree, accidentally discovered the handle of this long-buried tomahawk. The madness which resulted from this accident spread among all the tribes, and was increased by the circumstance of war having commenced about the same time between the Americans and the British. All the red people immediately and unadvisedly engaged in the contest, some on one side, some on the other; and we, brothers, instead of meeting in the peaceful council-house, encountered in the field. After a long contest between your late father the British, and your old father the American, the former acknowledged be was wrong, and agreed to make peace. Your American father, who ever regards with his own the happiness of the women and children of his enemies, agreed to make peace, and peace was accordingly made. The ceremonies which had just been performed wiped away the remembrance of all these circumstances; it ' now remained to bury that mischievous instrument of which he had been speaking, and which had been the cause of all our difficulties; but what method should they take to bury this mischievous instrument? It had once been buried under the roots of the largest tree in the forest, but wicked men could there find it. He thought of burying it under a great house, and putting that house not in the care of men, but under the protection of the Deity himself. His thunder and lightning would blast the arm of the wretch who should dare to take it. He now presented them with a bunch of wampum, an emblem that the tomahawk was buried under this great house; and, on their receiving the hands of the commissioners and the hands of the American war chiefs, they would consider war at an end and peace restored. [Hands received—council fire kindled.] We had now lighted the council fire, and it behooved them to return thanks to the Great Spirit, who, on this day, had blessed them with so many auspicious circumstances—a cloudless sky, a pleasant breeze, and the company of the. ladies. We ought to pray for some of the attributes of these ladies, who feel none of those angry and malignant passions which sometimes agitate the rougher sex. They have a lively interest in this council, for they and the tender pledges of their affection must feel severely the want of our good faith. As the council fire which had been kindled after the treaty of Greenville, to the south of this, was extinguished, it was the wish of the commissioners that this should now he the council fire of all the tribes, around which they should hereafter assemble under their leading’tribe, (the Wyandots,) who were the original proprietors; and this fire they wished extended as far as Brownstown, where it should be under its former keepers, the Wyandots, Ottawas, Pattawatamies, and Senecas. The second in command of the hostile Indians.—He was rejoiced to hear the news of peace. How pleasing it was to see assembled, at this place and at this time, all the white and red brethren, who had so long been parted and at variance; that all their voices should now be united in one, and that one for peace! He returned thanks to the Great Spirit for these blessings. Listen to what I have to say: I speak in the presence of the Great Spirit, from whose bounty and goodness we receive every thing, and from whose impulse we act. We solemnly promise that nothing but the mandate of the Great Spirit shall cause us to break the peace which we have now made. He sincerely wished for peace not only with the whites but with all the tribes, one with the other; and that that peace should be lasting. He gave thanks to the Great Spirit for this fine day, for this cloudless sky, this pleasant breeze, and the attendance of the women—to women who were the mothers of mankind, every reverence and respect were due. But this happy morning is ever to be remembered and admired; for on this morning, with the rising sun, they were met by the messenger who invited them to come and to meet in peace. Re was solemnly impressed with the ceremonies which had been performed; the ceremonies of their forefathers brought to their recollection their virtues and their fidelity to their engagements. The words which had been spoken had sunk deep into his heart, after his senses were restored, where they should remain like the bones which had been buried in security, and forever. He should never forget the counsel and advice of their wise and venerable chief, the Crane, who had performed those ceremonies, nor the instruction which they convey. We have, indeed, been distressed, and we have been far astray; but many others have gone astray. Our land has been spread with blood, and our bones have been scattered. But I hope all these bones are now collected; we will not stumble over them again to remind us of former hostilities, and that white board which protects them from injury may never be removed; recollecting the actions and precepts of our forefathers, we shall need no other inducement to act correctly. It is true what our father has told us of times past; he recalls the burying of the tomahawk, and the erection of a great tree over it to keep it forever hid; but, unfortunately, the tree withered and fell, and the tomahawk was discovered and raised. It is most true, also, that we have suffered much in consequence of it. But now that it is to be buried under the great house, under the protection of the Great Spirit, I hope and expect it will never be raised again. We agree with our father to bury it there, and join in the wish that the thunder and lightning of Heaven may blast the arm of him who attempts to raise it. We accept the wampum, emblem of peace, from our father and brothers, and beg leave to return it to them with similar sentiments. It is the wish and request of all who sit around me that the calumet be accepted and passed all around, and that they should recall the circumstance to mind every morning that the remembrance of it may never be obliterated; that the wampum, connecting their hands and arms together, should be remembered. They wished once more to join hands, an emblem that they should never be parted again, and that the scene of this transaction, the council-house, should ever be held in remembrance. It was delightful to observe the whole congregation smoking together the calumet of peace; but it was now growing late. We wish to hear our father first in the morning. Here at this council fire we will again meet to-morrow, again join hands, aud interchange our sentiments. SPRING WELLS, September 1, 1815. General Harrison.—He addressed those who were late our enemies, now our friends. He had been instructed by his old friend, the Crane, that he had omitted, inadvertently, a part of the ceremonies yesterday, which was to sweep around the council-house; lie would now do so; and he hoped that they might now repose without inconvenience around the council fires. My children, I now address all of you; I address you in the name of the great chief of the United States, and beg that you will attend to me. When people have quarrelled and have made friends, it is always unpleasant to recur to the causes which led to the quarrel. Under this impression, I shall forbear to tell those who have lately been our enemies that they were the first to lift the hatchet; I shall proceed to explain to you all the objects with which the commissioners are charged. You have all been informed that the United States and Great Britain, being mutually tired of war, had come to a determination to make peace. But if you have been told that this peace was sought after by the United States, and that they sent their ministers to England to solicit it, you have been grossly deceived. Both parties went into the territory of a Power that was neutral and equally friendly to both, the United States having absolutely refused to go to England for that purpose. That the willingness of the United States to make peace at that time was merely the effect of their fondness for peace, the posture of their affairs, which stood better at that period than at any other of the centest, would best evince. He would particularly cite the affairs of arms on the Niagara frontier. Victory was there claimed on both sides; but many of those who were there, and now present, could best tell with what propriety victory was claimed by the British. In giving you the history of those transactions, I shall give it to you with truth: I shall do justice to the bravery of the British troops during their contest with us, than whom no troops in the world behaved with more gallantry. The circumstance most disgraceful to the American arms was when the enemy was carrying on his operations against the city of Washington. The British, after beating and driving some of our militia who opposed them, entered the city where our great national councils were held, and burnt the house of our great chief. They, however, only staid there one day, and, having burnt a few bouses, went away. The same British general, with a much larger army, a few days after, made an attack on one of our great cities, (Baltimore,) defended by a few regular troops and some of our militia. This attack was repulsed, their general killed, and their army retired to their ships. In this contest, however, few were killed on either side. Ahout the same time the British army, under their great chief, Sir George Provost, (whom they all had heard of,) marched against our post at Plattsburgh; at the same time his army was marching by land, their fleet, equal at least in force to the American fleet, came with him, and attacked them off Plattsburgh. The result was, the almost entire destruction or capture of the whole of the British fleet, and a carnage hardly ever paralleled. At the same time, Sir George, with an army, we say of fifteen thousand, but as he says of eight thousand operated against our fort, defended by about fifteen hundred, and was repulsed and driven back. This Sir George is now in England to be tried for not doing what they think he could have done; whether he is guilty or not, we do not know; all we know, and perfectly know, is, that he was defeated. On the great waters, where our vessels of war have been engaged, ours have almost uniformly been successful. Only in two instances, where the force was nearly equal, has the American navy been unsuccessful. So far have those vessels of war sought each other, that the news of peace has hardly reached them. We have just heard of a hard-fought battle between our ships, in which the British were defeated, having the captain, another officer, and fourteen men killed; our vessel having only four or five killed. Any of the British officers could tell them of this fact. He was now going to inform them of an event so miraculous that they could hardly believe it, but he called on the Great Spirit to attest the truth of it, and which any of the British officers would confirm. Our city of Orleans was defended by about five thousand militia of the western country, commanded by one of our great war chiefs, Jackson. The British, amounting to eight thousand men, came to attack it, but they were repulsed and beaten, having lost, as we say, between two and three thousand, and, as the British acknowledge, fifteen hundred killed on the field; while, on our side, (he speaks in the presence of the Great Spirit,) not more than eight or ten were killed. He would do injustice to the British if he did not inform them that their troops behaved with the most determined bravery. The Americans were posted behind a breastwork. The British, headed by their generals, moved on them in column. The Americans were from the western country, and knew the use of a gun; every shot took effect from our riflemen, while the cannon concentrated their fire upon the enemy. At the time that peace was made, the territory which either had acquired was trifling and comparatively equal. The British had Castine, Bowyer, Niagara, and Mackinac, which were all small, commanding little more than the ground they stood on; and we had acquired, as they all knew, the western district of Upper Canada. Such was the posture of affairs when the British and Americans had agreed to make peace; they asked each other, what shall we do for the red people! They have assisted us in the war, let us extend peace to them also; let the King of Great Britain extend his hand to those who have fought against him, and let the President of the United States extend his hand to those who have fought against the United States. Let us all have peace. They therefore agreed that there should he peace, and forgiveness for and oblivion to past hostilities; and that the Indians should be placed on the same footing and in the same situation that they were immediately previous to the war, provided the Indians themselves should agree to these conditions and be willing to hold them by the hand. The United States more readily agreed to this arrangement, because they were at that time only at war with parts of tribes. The Wyandots, for instance, were many of them hostile, while their great chief was ever the most faithful of their friends. They could not strike an enemy without wounding a friend; they therefore resolved to wipe the tears from the eyes of all, and, in pity to all, to make peace. Agreeably to the treaty, the President had appointed the commissioners for the purpose of extending his hand to them. They had accepted their hand in that council, but they must identify that acceptance by a solemn treaty in the sight of Heaven. The United States had nothing to ask of them; peace was a boon which they gave without asking an equivalent; all that was required was for them to accept or reject it; if the latter, that part of the treaty of Ghent which regarded it was at an end. It was ever the custom of the United States to do every thing in the face of day. For this purpose they held their council at this public place, and in this public'manner; all might here come, even the British officers. There stood at his left hand an officer of the British Government, who had fought against the United States, on behalf of his King and country, who came there by the invitation of the commissioners, they conceiving him to be a man of an enlightened and liberal mind. All men might here learn if they should say any thing improper to them, and at the same time would bear evidence to the engagements they should enter into, and should be witness if they were broken. He separately addressed himself to those who remained faithful to the United States. My children, the President of the United States, your father, esteems you as he ought. You have stood by him in the hour of danger, for which he thanks you. Now he requests you tu make peace with the British. The United States will do every thing in their power to prevent you from waging war against them, or any of their subjects. But if yon do contrary to their advice, you do it on your own responsibility, and without our assistance. He addressed himself to those who had been hostile. Chiefs and warriors, if what we have told you has not been told to you by the British agents, you have been deceived; I solemnly declare to you that it has been the instructions of their Government; and they were not to aid or assist you in any hostile views which you might have meditated against the United States. It is now time to put an end to this long talk, lest our heads should be too full and our bellies empty. We will cover the council fire for this evening, that you may refresh yourselves. We wish you to draw provisions in the evening, that we may breakfast earlier, and that we may be enabled to do more during the day. ,	SPRING WELLS, September 2, 1815. General Harrison.—He could not explain to them the wishes of their great father, the President, better than they were conveyed by himself in his instructions to the commissioners. He then read that part of the instructions which directed or explained— 1st. That no new grants were required of them; 2d. The cultivation of good-will; the confirmation of all former treaties; 3d. Former treaties to be carried into effect; 4th. No interfering to prevent the surveying of lands already purchased and paid for by the United States; 5th. Example of good faith and a regard to their happiness so long as they manifest the same to the American family. These were the words of the President himself; and a greater confidence could not be placed in them than was manifested by reading these instructions to them; the literal meaning of all which was to place them precisely in the same situation in which they were previous to the war. As two of the commissioners, General McArthur and Mr. Graham, were sick, and himself unwell; as they were comfortably provided for, and the succeeding day was Sunday, he wished the council adjourned until Monday, at which time he hoped to hear them. He reminded them that there was a secretary to the commissioners, whose duty it was to minute the proceedings and the observations made on either side; by which means the President would know the sentiments and opinions, not only of each tribe, but of each individual. The delay would enable them to arrange their communications in such a manner as not to commit themselves. Another inducement to the adjournment was the probability of the arrival of the Indians from Mackinac before Monday, as a vessel which was soon expected had instructions to receive them on board. SPRING WELLS, September 4, 1815. General Harrison observed that the commissioners were well satisfied with the address received in their chamber by the Crane, and said to be the same delivered by the Prophet to the assembly of Indians; but as it was not delivered in council, the commissioners requested that they would appoint some one to deliver it there, that it might be committed to paper. If their sentiments were the same as were expressed, the council could be terminated by a treaty in a few days. As the whole tribe of the Miamies were admitted to the friendship of the United States at Greenville last year, as, also, some bands of the Chippewa, Pattawatamie, and Ottawa tribes, he wished to know if those last named tribes were represented in the council, that they might all now, as entire tribes, be included and made parties to the treaty. The Pattawatamies ,of the Illinois would meet other commissioners; those of St. Joseph’s, and east of it, were expected here. He wished to know if they were represented.! The Shawanee Prophet addressed the council in a speech, the tenor and subject of which was pacific. He said that he spoke on behalf of nine nations—those who had remained with the British, and who had lately come from the other side of the river, and be spoke to the Seventeen Fires, and the four nations who had stood by their side. The British had told them of the treaty which they had made with the Americans on the other side of the great waters, and to their great joy taken the tomahawk out of their hands. They then came nearly opposite this place, where the news of the arrival of the commissioners met them and communicated universal satisfaction. They had now come over to this side; and here also the tomahawk was taken out of their hands, so that they were now so completely deprived of tomahawks that he was apprehensive that their old women could hardly cut wood enough to make a fire. They were not only willing and anxious for peace, but they wanted that peace to be solid and permanent. Here they had kindled the council fire. At this council fire they would hereafter assemble, and speak through the nations who were the keepers of the fire, as they used to do in old times. All who came from the other side of the river were pleased with the address of tbe commissioners, and all took them heartily by the hand. They were very much pleased with what was expressed the other day of the care and attention which should be paid to their women and children. They and all their young men felt tenderly for their women and children, and were rejoiced to throw aside that mischievous instrument where it should not be again seen by their youug men. Indeed, they cast every thing from them that they might more readily extend their hands. It was the universal wish of the nine nations to be at peace and in security, and, being so, to do no wrong. He almost stood alone; he had but two chiefs with him. If there were more, there might be a diversity of opinion; but now there was none; they spoke from the bottom of their hearts. He was not skilled in speaking English; he must speak the truth, for he spoke in the presence of the Great Spirit. In his presence, I say, brothers, let us take care of our women and children. Let us adhere to our chiefs, and thank them for what they have done for us; although we are warriors, let us attend now to our women and children, and cast behind us the implements of war, and never look at them again. [He addressed all the Indians.] Let us be firmly united, hold fast by each other, and direct our united efforts to take care of our families; nor suffer them, as they have been, tu be dispersed and in want. This was the wish of those from the other side with him. Brothers and warriors (the commissioners and officers) here at this council, we take you by the hand, [shakes hand.] I don’t call you fathers, but brothers. Tell my sentiments to the President; he is my father. [He addressed himself to his young men, asking them if they heard him and approved his sentiments. He also requested that his address might be interpreted to the other tribes.] Now, brothers, we have done a good thing. Let there be no reproach or recrimination between us. While speaking, I have heard one of our children crying as we have made peace, let him be released. (One confined for murder.) The Pattawatamie Prophet.—Brothers and warriors: We, I presume, understand each other. We have heard what has been said. All know that a solemn treaty is to be made. If there is any man who does not understand, or disagrees, let him rise up and declare it. Let us return thanks to the Great Spirit that we have a return of peace. We Pattawatamies speak little. I shall be short, and to the purpose. I claim your attention. How pleasing to be assembled together, and to communicate to each other our sentiments! I shall speak my sentiments, and speak them freely. We three nations speak together, being of one mind. How flattering to the three nations that they should be so united in opinion as to consider themselves as one nation! Let us then speak freely to our father at this time, that there may be no equivocation hereafter. Around the council fire has been swept. We have now a clear place to repose. The roads are open and smooth. Our women and children can stray without impediment. For these things let us return thanks to the Great Spirit.	, You Wyandots have near you the person of our father the President, and have heard his words. If you have reported his words to us correctly, we shall agree hereafter with you in sentiment, as we agree'to speak with and through you. We flatter ourselves that you have told us the truth. You have come from the President, and with what you have told us we are highly pleased, and here accede to. Let there be no reflections or recriminations between us hereafter. Let there be nothing but peace. How pleasing to meet with those from the other side of the river who have been hostile! They are the same flesh, the same nation, and the same species of inhabitants with us. How pleasing that they are agaiu coming to reside among us! I address myself particularly to the American Indians. Let us return thanks to the Great Spirit—that Being who created all things—that we are now united; nor let us be ever forgetful of what is now done for our women and children. Let us realize the happy reflection that, when we are gone on the hunt, we leave them, without apprehension, in peace and security. We thank you for the ceremonies which have been performed for the purpose of correcting our senses, that your words might sink into our hearts. I thank you for so doing; but it was unnecessary. My heart and my sentiments were with you already. You American Indians! We thank you for the kind words which you brought to us. You came not only with your own kind speeches, but brought with you those of our father the President, telling us of peace and friendship. Brothers, Wyandots! We Pattawatamies inhabiting the same country with yourselves, what I say to you is with the sanction of all; what I say may be relied on; my nation will stand by me. Whatsoever you say or do for us towards the United States, we sanction. We thank you for speaking in our behalf, for correcting our senses; and we here>present you, the Wyandots, with this wampum, the memorial of our thanks. We wish you to speak after us. 1 speak on behalf of the Pattawatamie nation. [To Tarhee, the chief of the Wyandots:] The Pattawatamies presented their thanks for his speakiug in their behalf. The wampum then given should be a memorial of the friendship of the Pattawatamies for the Wyandots. This was the wish of the chiefs, warriors, and young men of his tribe.	. Wyandots and Shawanees! The Pattawatamies take you by the hand. Tell yuur children of this our profession of friendship for your tribes, and do you old men retain it in recollection. We wish you to speak your sentiments. After you, the chiefs of our nation will speak. General Harrison.—An unfortunate accident had happened between two Indian warriors, one of whom it was supposed was killed. They could not sit in council when blood was shed so near them, nor deliberate when one of the tribes must be in grief for the loss of one of their nation. The council would therefore be adjourned. SPRING WELLS, September 5, 1815. The Crane, (Tarhee.)—Listen to what I have to say: yesterday we had some talk; we four nations return thanks to the three nations, Pattawatamies, &c. They have corrected our senses, and we return thanks to the Great Spirit that we are assembled here and united together in council. After this purification of our senses and adjustment of our hearts, every thing which we see or hear appears pleasant to us; for this we thank you. He thanked them for what they had done yesterday; he had not performed all, the ceremonies; those that they had performed showed that they had not forgotten the language of their forefathers; he had to apologize for the omission of some by himself. There was a time when the land was in trouble, and the council fire at which they were accustomed to sit was destroyed. This was an unfortunate circumstance, and is to be ascribed to the fault of our fathers of Great Britain and America, and those of our children who took part with them. This has been a source of much grief to the chiefs, that their council fire should be destroyed wherat they assembled. When this unfortunate circumstance took place, all the Indian nations took part with one or the other, until all were distracted and so disunited that no one nation could say that it was entirely on one side. At length, brothers, our fathers, the British and American, agreed to make peace; and, taking their red children into view, have afforded them the same advantages with themselves. This wise regulation was made by their two fathers, seeing that their council fire was extinguished, and they have now kindly rekindled it. Our father, the British, in order to have a fire on his side, has either taken it from the old place on this side, where it properly belongs, or has made one of his own. Our fathers who are silting here have kindled for us a council fire at this place, which is to extend to Brownstown—a council fire whereat all the nations may assemble. They have done it wisely. Let us thank them for it. This fire is kindled by the President, by his commissioners. It is pure and it is his own. It burns that all the nations may see it. I hope you will all join with me in thanks, in thanks sincere and from the bottom of your hearts, to the President, for kindling for us this pure fire. , It was kind in our brothers from the other side of the river, after the fire was kindled, to come over and trim it, that it might burn brighter; they, seeing its blaze from the other side, did every thing in their power to promote .the good work; they besought us to take care of it, particularly the Wyandots, &c., who were the keepers of the fire. Thus they spoke; I will repeat their speech: “You Wyandots, particularly, attend to this council fire; cherish the good work, that peace may extend to the Creeks, thence westward, and around, embracing all the Indians. You must not say that you are incompetent to the task, that you are not sufficiently skilled in the mysteries and ceremonies of your forefathers; you at least know enough to answer the purpose, and you must not relinquish, through indolence, a thing of such great importance.” He called on all to listen attentively to him at this great council fire which their fathers had prepared for them. I shall try to follow the footsteps of our forefathers. Wherever was the council fire of our ancestors, there were their minds; here is onr council fire, here then be all our minds. Place your minds at this spot. I speak from the bottom of my heart when I wish they may never wander. Be fixed here, and here be united. Our forefathers had a maxim that they had but one road to travel in; that road was peace—a road which women and children could travel in security; a road made by their ancestors. I have said that this was the road of our ancestors; let me invite you into it. The Great Spirit inspired those ancestors with the knowledge of it; then let all turn their faces towards it. Step into this road of your forefathers; it is endless, and.it is safe even for your women and children; the only one which is good and broad. Listen all to the language of your forefathers: they exhort you to continue in this road; they say it is dangerous to stop out of it; steep precipices and dark unfathomable gulfs bind close upon it. All, far and near, are now travelling in this peaceful road of our forefathers. We must bear in mind that our white fathers may again fall out; and our British father has ever been most ready to give us the tomahawk. Let us join neither of them hereafter. If they fight, let us retire to one side. They quarrel about things of w hich we know nothing, and in which we are not interested. They quarrel for a time, then make friends, and we make friends also, and join hands again as fast as ever. He exhorts all, both far and near, to keep in this peaceful path, to take care of their women and children, and to hold fast by the United States when they take hold again. He exhorts the warriors to hold fast to this good work, to consider the people of the United States, and to treat them as brothers. Their happiness will result from it, and the Great Spirit will crown them with prosperity. He particularly cautions the warriors and young men of the necessity of paying attention to this good work. Wherever they meet with their white brethren, salute them kindly; treat them as relatives, and avoid any difficulties. Attention to these matters is of the highest importance, as they are the means of securing and preserving friendships. Give no attention to bad birds; some of them are ever flying about; turn a deaf ear to them. Remember the precepts of your forefathers, the precepts which were given to them by the Great Spirit. Turn your attention to this council fire which our father, the President, has kindled for us. Keep your minds here, and you will enjoy many years of peace and happiness. You have all heard what has been said. We are now fast bound to the United States. We require you to inform all who are distant and absent that we are bound by the hand and arm to the United States. As you have appointed the Wyandots to take charge of the council fire, we depend on you to publish that information, that they may be respected accordingly. As the council fire is intrusted to him, he begs all their assistance to keep it secure. He gives wampum memorial of the transaction. A few words more. The road leading to the council fire from all the distant brethren, which was cut by their forefathers, had grown up and was choked with briers. He would now clear it, that all who turn their faces towards the council fire might travel with security and pleasure. For the speech of the Pattawatamies, delivered yesterday, uniting with them in council and sentiment, they return thanks; they were well satisfied with it. General Harrison, in looking around, discovered that many were absent; (this was the day on which the Shawanee Prophet and his followers left the council;) he asked if they left any message, or if any could assign a reason for their absence. The commissioners could not avoid thinking very singularly of their going off in that manner. As no person answered, he presumed that no message was left; he would therefore inform them of the course which the commissioners were determined to pursue. Although, by the advice of the Crane, they had performed all the Indian ceremonies, yet there were none of the Indians that did not know that ovr customs required that they should sign a paper which declared their agreements. They all knew that at Greenville the great chief (General Wayne) and all their principal men signed a paper. These commissioners would also make out one, and lay it before them for their signatures, which should describe nothing which had not been explained to them before—that the United States and the Indians should be at peace, and that the Indians should be placed in the same situation in which they were previous to the war. As those who had absented themselves had been once invited, he would not again do so; if any of those present felt friendly towards them, they might give them notice, and the council would delay its meeting until 3 o’clock; if they then attended, it would be considered that they were not absent; if not, they should forever be excluded from the treaty which should then be prepared. The commissioners do not wish to be understood as prohibiting them from coming over. Any individual may return and join his tribe if he does so peaceably. The Shawanees, for instance, may come and join their tribe; but as a nation (if they refuse to sign the treaty) they will not be permitted to kindle a fire separate from the fire or independent of the chiefs of their nation. À warrior of the Pattawatamies from the other side came in and reproached his tribe for saying that the absent Indians had left the council in displeasure. They had left it well pleased, and, imagining that every thing was finished, had retired. Another Indian, being interrogated, averred that an Indian from the other side told him that the British had sent word that they wanted them to come over to a council which they were about to hold, and that a speech was absolutely sent to this side. The first named warrior then observed that the reason of their going was that too many women and children were here; that they would commit no depredations on the property of the citizens; and that they thought it not worth the while to attend longer, as every thing was done. General Harrison, addressing the Pattawatamie warrior, told him that he might listen to what he was going to say; be would not ask him to tell it, but he might do so. Why, my brothers, has the British agent sent for the Indians to leave this council? Has any thing been said improperly to you? Have not many of their chiefs attended this council? What has been said against the red coats, that they should act in this manner? The United States knew their strength, knew their ability to ward off any attack so well, that they never have asked assistance, and they never would have asked their red children, if the enemy had not invited them by their example to do so; and then it was done knowing that the fondness of young men for war would induce them ail to join the enemy if not employed by us. Your American father asks nothing of you but for your own benefit. He asks you to bury the tomahawk. Is that to your disadvantage? Have you been asked for your lands, or for any thing else? Why was the speech sent in this sneaking manner? We do every thing in open day. Every person might see and hear us. British officers might attend if they chose. The weather was pleasant, nothing prevented them. If this was a good speech, why was it not delivered in public as ours are? The council would be adjourned until 3 o’clock the next day. We will not be rash in ascribing a bad intention to those who have gone away; if they attend to-morrow, we shall consider them as being always present. SPRING WELLS, September 6, 1815. The commissioners explained to the tribes the substance of the treaty. SPRING WELLS, September 7, 1815. The treaty was interpreted to the Indians as written, and the names of the subscribers taken. SPRING WELLS, September 8, 1815. The treaty signed and sealed by the commissioners on behalf of the United States, and the sachems, headmen, and warriors of the Wyandot, Delaware, Shawanee, Seneca, Ottawa, Chippewa, Pattawatamie, and Miama tribes. A chief of the Pattawatamies.—He said that he saluted the commissioners, and thanked the Great Spirit that the treaty was now finally concluded. He thanked the commissioners, and thanked the President of the United States, that they were placed in the same situation that they stood by the ancient treaty of Greenville. All the cessions of the lands made by the Indians were confirmed. He gave his consent, though with reluctance. It was the act iff their ancestors, who were, perhaps, less enlightened than those of this period. But why should we uncover the graves of the dead, and disturb their ashes? He would not doit. Let the dead rest in peace. He would not reflect upon their memories. He would rather say their acts were wise. If, however, it were (o do again, he would pause; he would reflect. He would look at his children in the cradle, and ask what right he had to injure those innocents? what authority he had to deprive them of their rights? He hoped that whilst they walked upon the grounds they had acquired of the Indians, they would remember and commiserate their situation. He was afraid that their annuities would not be sufficient for them, and hoped that they would, when necessary, throw in something in addition to that which they were entitled to by treaty. It had pleased the Master of the Universe to place the Indians upon this land, but the scene was now changed. Their ancestors had parted with it. He begged the commissioners that they would not listen to little stories circulated to their prejudice. He again saluted the commissioners, and called the Great Spirit to witness, as was the custom of the Americans when they opened a solemn council. Paean, chief of the Miami tribe.—He accounted for their joining their old father the British during the war; expressed his satisfaction at the return of peace, and at the renewal of the treaty of Greenville. He was also much rejoiced that no new concessions of land were demanded of them. They were much distressed from the scarcity of animals, and requested that white, men might be prohibited from hunting on their lands. General Harrison had just been informed by one of our citizens that a Wyandot bad told him that the British told the Indian that, by the treaty of Ghent, the American Government should pay for the injury done their property at Brownstown. It was a lie. They knew it was a lie when they uttered it; and they might tell them that he said it was a lie. There was no such thing contained in the treaty of Ghent. The Seventeen Fires intend to satisfy their own friends; but injuries done to those fighting against them they will not atone for. The Indians had a just claim on the British for a compensation for those losses. He would not be understood that the United States made the British promise in the treaty to do so. It was a thing with which the United Slates had nothing to do. But as the British had seduced them from their duties to the United States, and, by so doing, brought those calamities upon them, it was but fair and just that they should compensate them for it. The British knew better than to propose such a thing to our ministers at Ghent. They knew that it would have been refused with indignation. But such a proposition was never made. 4 E 14th CONGRESS.]
