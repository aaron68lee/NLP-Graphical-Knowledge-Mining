NO. 212.	[1st SESSION. ABOLITION OF THE INDIAN TRADING-HOUSES. COMMUNICATED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, MAY 25, 1824. Mr. COCKE made the following report: The Committee on Indian Affairs, to whom was referred a resolution on the 26th of March last, in the following words, viz: “ Resolved, That the Committee on Indian Affairs be instructed to complete the inquiry which was commenced at the last session, and reported upon in part, [See No. 196,] into the execution of an act entitled * An act to abolish the Indian trading establishment, approved on the	day of	, 1822;’ and also to inquire what general average per centum, over and above tho prime cost and carriage, for which articles of merchandise were sold by the factory agents before the passage of the law aforesaid; the amount of money which ought to have been returned to the Government upon the abolition of the establishment; the amount which has actually been paid into the treasury, together with that which has been secured to be paid under the provisions of the law for abolishing said establishment; and if, by contrasting said sums, a balance shall be found due to the Government, what mode can be devised to recover the same from the person or persons withholding it;” report: That, from the report of the Committee on Indian Affairs, made at the last session of the seventeenth Congress, it appears that $290,000 were drawn from the treasury, for the purpose of carrying into effect the views of the Government in the establishment of the Indian trading-houses. This capital, being embarked in a trade in which private individuals make considerable profits, ought to have been returned undiminished upon the abolition of the establishment, if that trade had been conducted with ordinary good management. But, upon the passage of the law to abolish the Indian trading-houses, all the property, consisting of merchandise, cash, furs and peltries, Indian and other debts, and buildings, surrendered to the agents, amounted only to $269,673 92. The statement marked “ General statement No 1” will give a view of the. Indian trading establishment at the time of its abolition. The accounts which accompany that statement, marked from A to K, inclusive, show the amount and the various kinds of property at the several factories; the accounts from L to N, inclusive, the amount of salaries, balances, &c. up to the time of the surrender. The accounts marked from No. 1 to No. 8, inclusive, will show the proceeds of the sales of the property so received. The account marked No 9 will show the sales of the property deposited in Georgetown. The account marked No. 10 will show the amount of losses sustained in the sales of furs and peltries. The account marked No. 11 will show the receipts and expenditures by the agent who was appointed to close the business of the establishment. The account No. 12 is a consolidated statement, which exhibits a general view of the amount of the sales, and of the application of such part as has been received in cash. From this statement, it will be seen that the sum of $38,178 15 has been paid into the treasury; the sum of $52,951 41 in bills receivable, and said to be good, is secured to be paid. The sum of $17,367 27 has been paid in debts, salaries, and contingencies, <fcc., leaving the sum of $76,400 37 as the amount of Indian and other debts, and $69,862 70 as the amount of losses on the sales and of property yet to be accounted for. The committee are unable to ascertain the average advance laid upon their goods by the late factors engaged in the Indian trade; but, from the extracts and copies of letters marked from No. 1 to No. 11, from the superintendent to them, it appears that sixty-eight per centum was to be considered the standard advance to cover all contingent expenses and losses, leaving to their prudence and discretion the power to increase or lessen it, as circumstances might require. If, therefore, the fund set apart by the Government for the purposes of Indian trade had been managed with such a regard for the public interests as individuals of ordinary prudence observe in their own affairs, it is not doubted but that the Indian trading establishment might have been maintained without any loss of its capital, if it did not yield a profit sufficient to reimburse the Government the expense of supporting it. But, upon looking into the accounts of the factors, sufficient evidence will be found to establish the belief that no business conducted upon such principles could be persevered in without a total loss of the whole capital. At the six factories from which complete returns have been received, the sum of $28,692 68 is reported as the amount of the Indian debts alone. But how long this debt has been accumulating—whether from the foundation of the establishment, or for a few years only—the committee have no means of determining. It is such a sum, however, as could not have arisen if the factors had had a due regard for the public interests, or if a proper watchfulness had been maintained by the superintendent. As complete returns have not been received from two of the factories, it is impossible, at this time, to state the precise amount of the loss of the Government upon closing the concerns of the establishment; but it is believed that the amount of the Indian and other debts, and the losses on the sales, Ac., making, together, the sum of $146,263 07, may be stated as the probable amount. Upon this supposition, the sum of $123,410 85 will be returned to the Government; but this sum will be increased by the amount of debts or property hereafter received. The committee, however, have no means'of ascertaining the sum which will probably be received from either of those sources. That the Indian debts are totally lost, is fully believed. But they are of opinion that the laws of the United States, if enforced, point out the means of recovering such debts as are due from the establish- lishment. Without pretending to offer any resolution at this time, the committee content themselves with referring to the documents which accompany this report, and submit them to the House to take such measures as may he deemed most expedient.	, GENERAL STATEMENT—No. 1.

Copy of a circular from John Mason, Superintendent of Indian Trade, to Agents, dated SIR:	INDIAN OFFICE, GEORGETOWN, December 12, 1807. Previous to the reception of this letter, you will have received from the Secretary of War your commission as agent of Indian trade at	. By his directions, I now transmit you the instructions which are to govern your conduct. 1st. The prices you put on the goods you have on sale must necessarily vary according to circumstances; but that which you will consider as the. standard advance on the price charged in the invoices furnished from this office will be at the rate of sixty-eight per cent.; and this you will consider as the estimate to cover the cost of transporta tion, and to yield such profit only as will indemnify the establishment for the expenses at your trading-house, and on the returns made by you to bring round the sales of furs and peltries without loss. As to the prices allowed to Indians for the skins, you will be governed generally by those to which they have been accustomed, and at which yon can obtain them without giving them dissatisfaction; but, after all, much must be left to your discretion and prudence, so to reduce or raise your prices, as compared with the standard advance, and with the rate you may be obliged to allow for skins, as to enable us to pay all charges and to avoid sinking money. To enable you to judge of which, the rate of sales of the skins received from you will be occasionally furnished you. 2d. The goods to be sent you are intended for sale to the Indians, and it is the express direction of the Secretary of War “ that no white persons are to be considered as having any right to be furnished with factory goods, and, except in very particular and pressing cases, no sales should be made to white persons of any description whatsoever, and in no case but for prompt pay and at an advance of ten per cent, on the Indian prices; and yon will be held accountable for the payment of all articles sold to white people on credit. Credits may, however, be given, with caution, to principal chiefs of good character.” If a professed white trader wants goods, you are not to sell him, at any price, any article that you may possibly be in want of for the Indians. If you have a surplus of others, you may, using great caution, sell them; but then only at an advance of ten per cent, on the current prices. 3d. As before instructed, a suitable guard will, if necessary, be furnished you, (by order of the Secretary of War,) by the officer commanding the garrison near you. .You will, however, be absent as little as possible from the store. An interpreter, when necessary, will be furnished; and it is of importance, that he should be a person of sober, discreet, and temperate habits, and attached to the interest of the United States. 4th. You are restricted by law from carrying on any trade, commerce, or barter, on your own account, or any other, except for the United States, as you will observe by the sixth section of the law establishing Indian tradinghouses, passed on the 21st April, 1806. You will on all occasions so demean yourself towards the Indians generally, and towards the chiefs in particular, as to obtain and preserve their friendship, to be conciliatory in all your intercourse with them, and, by every proper means in your power, to secure their attachment to the United States. 5th. The sale of ardent spirits is most strictly prohibited. 6th. You will furnish me with your list of articles wanted as early in the season as possible, it being of great advantage to have ample time to make purchases. Let your lists be full, clear, explicit in description as to each article, and always bear in mind that good supplies must depend on adequate remittances. 7th. You will take the greatest possible care to ascertain and examine the quality of the furs and peltries you receive, see that their quality is fairly proportioned to the prices allowed, and that their condition is good; to preserve them with attention while in your possession, and to send them off in good order, carefully and safely packed; and, particularly, you are to be watchful to avoid the imposition of private traders who may attempt to make instruments of the Indians, or otherwise to put off on you bad skins, and to get hold of your goods for the purposes of their trade. Take in as small a proportion of deer skins as you can with propriety do, and forward whatever you receive as returns (cash, notes, and drafts excepted,) to Joseph Saul, New Orleans,* and Governor Clark, St. Louis.t Forward to me the invoices, respectively, as you send off the articles. 8th. All remittances of bills, notes, or cash, must be made to me, and under my direction; and you are to correspond with, and take orders on all commercial operations from, and keep all accounts with me. If any communications of a civil or political nature be necessary, you will make them separately, and in direct correspondence with the Secretary of War. If any of the officers of Government, who are well known to you, want cash, you may take their drafts for it on any of the Departments at Washington. 9th. You will keep correct accounts of every transaction in a day-book, journal, leger, and cash-book; in the day-book, every thing must be recorded. You will also keep an invoice-book and a letter-book. You will render me * For the southern factories.	| For the factories on the Upper Mississippi and Missouri. “ quarter-yearly accounts of all money, goods, and property whatsoever, which shall be transmitted you, or which shall come into your hands; and you shall transmit duplicates of your accounts to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States.” These accounts you will make up to the last days (inclusively) of March, June, September, and December, in each year; they will comprise abstracts of your account books, balanced up to, and including, those days respectively, as to sales, receipts, expenditures, and stock on hand: the stuck on hand detailed clearly and accurately by inventory. This puint, as to making up to the given day and transmitting regularly your accounts and inventory, is so essential that it must not be dispensed with in auy instance; and you roust be as early as possible, after the time to which made up, in sending them off. Assuring you of my prompt attention to all your communications, and with the best wishes for the success of your trading-house, I am, &c.	JOHN MASON, S. I. T. No. 2. Extract of a letter from General John Mason, Superintendent of Indian Trade, to Geo. S. Gaines, the Factor in the Choctaw nation, dated MARCH 2, 1808. I am sorry to see that, of $7,313 65, amount in cost of the two invoices, there is as much as $5,690 in deer skins. This article will inevitably destroy the fund of this establishment, unless we can take them in much smaller quantities, or at by far lower prices. I received, a few days since, account of sales of 30,894 lbs. deer skins, and 81 skins, whereof 23,270 lbs. and the 81 skins were from your trading-house; 7,624 lbs. from the Chickasaw factory, shipped by General Shee, last summer, to Bordeaux; they were invoiced by him at 26J cents per lb., and the 81 skins at 2s. 3d. each; and, at this rate, amounted on board, including $26 shipping charges, to $8,246 91. The nett amount of sales 9,788 francs, equal to $1,835 25. Clear loss $6,411 60. ,	No. 3. Extract of a letter from John Mason, Superintendent of Indian Trade, to John Johnson, Factor at the river Des Moines, dated INDIAN OFFICE, May 16, 1809. I remark the credit of about $1,400 you had given the chiefs, and the pacotilles of about equal amount to Dorion and Blundow: all which is approved; and I have no doubt but operations of this kind, conducted with' prudence, will do good. But you should not send any trader into the interior without consulting Governor Lewis, as he will best know, from time to time, when it may not be politic to trade with certain tribes. No. 4. Extract of a letter from Thomas L. McKenney, Superintendent of Indian Trade, to Major Daniel Hughes, Factor at Fort Hawkins, dated APRIL 29, 1816. It will be proper for you to examine and settle all the books belonging to the trading-house, as they may stand when you take charge of it; also, to begin a new set of accounts with the stock with which you commence. This factory has, for several years, been doing a losing business; in your hands, I trust, it will be revived. No. 5. Extract of a letter from Thomas L. McKenney, Superintendent of Indian Trade, to Isaac Rawlings, Factor to the Chickasaws, dated AUGUST 23, 1816. / I hasten to communicate to you a reply to so much of your letter as relates to the description of goods now on hand at the factory, and respecting the prices at present allowed the Indians for their deer skins. I am aware that the goods sent you, and which lie so inactively on hand, are not suited to the business in which you are engaged; but it so happened that, when my predecessor sent them, our country was unable to furnish better, or a kind more suited to the tastes of the Chickasaws. My instructions to you on this head are, to sell those goods, even if they bring no more than cost, in preference to keeping them on hand, subject as they will be to loss and damage. I have to request, also, that you engage actively in running them off, to make way for the very excellent supply now sent you. No. 6. Extract of a letter from Thomas L. McKenney, Superintendent of Indian Trade, to Major Daniel Hughes, dated INDIAN OFFICE, May 26, 1817. I have received your letter of the 1st instant; also, Mr. Bowen’s statement of certain evils of which he complains, and which he assigns as the cause of the unforfunate exhibit of another quarter’s loss, larger than the former. I apprehend, unless something can be done, there will be no remedy but a total breaking up of that factory. I cannot, consistently with my office, look on a repetition of losses without stopping them; and if intermediate means are not interposed, the last remedy must be applied. No. 7. Extract of a letter from Thomas L. McKenney, Superintendent of Indian Trade, to George C. Sibley, Factor at Fort Osage, dated JUNE 17, 1817. I can readily conceive the necessity you have been under to sell off your stock at reduced prices. 66 E No. 8. Extract of a letter from the Superintendent of Indian Trade to Isaac Rawlings, the Chickasaw Factor, dated ■	INDIAN OFFICE, July 14, 1817. I regret to learn the loss of the peltries, in* their passage to Mr. Saul. I do not understand from your letter whether a part, or the whole, was lost. I could wish it had been otherwise, as every little drawback like this is discouraging in the view, when it is called for,- of the prosperity of the trade. It was without your control, however, and is a case without remedy. .	No. 9. Extract of a letter from Thomas L. McKenney, Superintendent of Indian Trade, to Joseph Saul, Agent for Factories, New Orleans, dated INDIAN OFFICE, May 16, 1820. I have received by your letter bf the 10th ultimo your returns of the sale of deer skins made by me, through William Jones, Esq. of Philadelphia, to Geisse and Korkhauss. The result is, indeed, painful; painful in another sense, besides the extraordinary, and, I believe, hitherto unequalled loss, which has been sustained, and which may make it necessary for me to institute an inquiry into it. I am fully aware of the importance of having the peltries at New Orleans by April; but I am also aware of the thousand obstacles which may put it out of the factor’s power to get them there by that season. In the parcel out of which has resulted - this uncommon loss, nearly all arrived in New Orleans in good time, save those from the Sulphor Fork factory; and even those, at no later period than you have often before received them, when no such loss as the present was experienced. But, when peltries do arrive out of time, the very object of the agency is to pay the greater attention to their preservation. This you may have done. I am sure you never designedly permitted the injury to happen; but your avocations, it is possible, might have led you to repose confidence in others, which might have been misplaced. However, I have this day notified Mr. Smith that 1 will adjust your account, and pay him, for you, the balance which may appear to be due. No. 10. Extract of a litter from Thomas L. McKenney, Superintendent of Indian Trade, to John IV. Johnson, Factor at Prairie du Chien,-dated SEPTEMBER 28, 1821. On the subject of the merchandise in the factory which may not be suited to the purposes of trade, but which may answer all the purposes of presents, it would be well to say to these gentlemen, that the interests of the Government will be consulted in this branch of its operations by their relieving the factory of the goods in question, so far as their wants may go; and you will put the goods at cost and charges, or cost, or even loss, as their condition, &c. may require, so as to bring them within the limits of the Secretary’s directions.	* No. 11. Extract of a letter from the Superintendent of Indian Trade to John W. Johnson, Factor at .Prairie du Chien, dated INDIAN OFFICE, September 25, 1821. I feel some anxiety about the accumulated amount of merchandise on hand at the factory in your charge; some of it having been for so many years on hand, and having been bought under unfavorable circumstances, puts it without the limits of a reasonable expectation of doing any thing with it to profit. I wish cost and charges could be got for it. You will make an invoice of every unsaleable or dead article, and remark upon the condition of each, so as to convey your opinion of its worth. And should opportunities occur by which you can dispose of this Selection usefully to the establishment, you will do so. I have communicated an offer to the Secretary of War of these goods, to be used as presents, in the event of their being wanted in that quarter. CONGRESS.]
