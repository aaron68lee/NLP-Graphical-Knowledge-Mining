TH: JEFFERSON. February 18, 1809. .Fiicles of a Treaty made and conduded at Brownstown, in the territory of Michigan, between JVilliain Hull, Governor of said territory, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, and Commissioner Plenipotentiary of the United States of America for concluding any treaty or treaties, which may be found necessary, icith any of the Indian tribes northwest of the river Ohio, of the one part; and the sachems, chiefs, and warriors, of the Chippewa, Ottawa, Puttawalumy, Wyandot, and Shuwanee nations of Indians, of the other part: Article 1. Whereas, by a treaty concluded at Detroit, on the the 17th day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seven, a tract of land lying to the west and north of the river Miami, of lake Erie, and principally within the territory of Michigan, was ceded by the Indian nations to the United States: And whereas the lands lying on the southeastern side of the said river Miami, and between said river and the boundary lines established by the treaties of Greenville and fort Industry, with the exception of a few small reservations to the United States, still belong to the Indian nations, so that the United States cannot, of right, open and maintain a convenient road from the settlements in the State of Ohio to the settlements in the territory of Michigan, nor extend those settlements so as to connect them: In order, therefore, to promote this object, so desirable and evidently beneficial to the Indian nations, as well as to the United States, the parties have agreed to the following articles, which, when ratified by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, shall be reciprocally binding: Art. 2. The several nations of Indians aforesaid, in order to promote the object mentioned in the preceding article, and in consideration of the friendship they bear towards the United States, for the liberal and benevolent policy which has been practised towards them by the Government thereof, do hereby give, grant, and cede, unto the said United States, a tract of land for a road of one hundred and twenty feet in width, from the foot of the Rapids of the river Miami, of lake Erie, to the western line of the Connecticut reserve, and all the land within one’ mile of the said road, on each side thereof, for the purpose of establishing settlements along the same? also, a tract of land, for a road only, of one hundred and twenty feet in width, to run southwardly from what is called Lower Sandusky, to the boundary line established by the treaty of Greenville, with the privilege of taking, at all times, such timber and other materials from the adjacent lands, as may be necessary for making and keeping in repair the said road, with the bridges that may be required along tlye same. Art. 3. It is agreed, that the lines embracing the lands given and ceded by the preceding article, shall be run in such directions as may be thought most advisable by the President of the United States, for the purposes aforesaid. Ar t. 1. It is agreed the said Indian nations shall retain the privilege of hunting and fishing on the lands given and ceded as above, so long as the same shall remain the property of the United States. Art. 5. The several nations of Indians aforesaid, do again acknowledge themselves to be under the protection of the United States, and of no other sovereign: and the United States, on their part, do renew their covenant to extend protection to them, according to the intent and meaning of stipulations in former treaties. Done at Brownstown, in the territory of Michigan, this twenty-fifth day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eight, and of the independence of the United States of America the thirty-third. WILLIAM HULL, Commissioner. [Signed, also, by a number of chiefs and warriors of the tribes enumerated in the title.] Detroit, 18//i November, 1808. Sir: 1 have the honor to transmit a treaty, which I have concluded with the Wyandot, Ottawa, Chippewa, Pat-tawatamy. and Shawanee nations. I took no measures, whatever, to influence them to make a voluntary present of the lands described in the treaty, to the United States. It was the result of their own wishes. I presume, it will be considered by the Government, as an evidence of their friendship and attachment to the United States, and their disposition to give every facility in their power to a free communication and intercourse. In holding the treaty, I had other objects, in which all the nations did not appear to be united. In this, there was a perfect union, and, believing myself, the purposes of opening a communication and connecting our settlements would be effected, I did not hesitate in giving it my concurrence. 1 have the honor to be, very respectfully, your most obedient servant, WILLIAM HULL. Honorable II. Dearborn, Secretary of War. Detroit, July '25th, 1803. Sir: I have endeavored,'in the following report, to ascertain, and state concisely,all those facts concerning which, I imagined, the Government would wish to be informed. It is little more than an outline, exhibiting the prominent features. The geographical marks are all made from actual observation; and I have, as seldom as the nature of the business would admit, depended on the information of others.. My inquiries commence at Otter creek, the southwesterly extremity of the settlements, from whence I proceeded regularly through them to the river Sinclair. I have avoided neither trouble nor fatigue, and have thus long delayed to advise you with respect to my progress, only that I might, by minute investigation, be enabled to give you a more satisfactory account. Should the report, however, be still defective, if I have omitted the notice of subjects which require investigation, you have only to instruct me, that I may renew my inquiries. I am, your most obedient humble servant, C. JOUETT. The Honorable Henry Dearborn, Esq. Secretary of the United States for the Department of I Car. 90 Mr. Jouett’s Report. Otter creek empties itself into lake Erie forty-two miles southwest of the town of Detroit, and six miles south of the river Raisin. The settlement commences at its motfth, on the lake, alid extends up the creek three miles. The native right was extinguished, by purchase, from the Pattawatainy, Ottawa, and Chippewa Indians, in the year 1779; and, in the year 1794, the present occupants, to the number of twenty-three, deriving their claims from the first purchasers, began their improvements. The farms contain from seventy-five to two hundred French acres, and their boundaries extend back from the creek in parallel lines. Those lands are fertile. Those immediately bordering on the lake have a rich, black soil, well adapted to the cultivation of wheat and hemp.. They are without timber of any kind; and, in the language of the country, are called prairies. The wood lands, further removed from the lake, abound in hickory, walnut, and elm, and have a soil of equal fertility, and, in a great degree, similar to those already described. Notwithstanding the many advantages this spot possesses in point of soil and convenience to market, the settlers are extremely poor. They are, however, considered freeholders, and, in their own minds, entertain few doubts respecting their titles. River Raisin is a delightful stream, navigable, for small craft, about sixteen miles; to the highest farm. It falls into the lake six miles north of Otter creek, and thirty-six south of Detroit. There are, in this settlement, one hundred and twenty-one families, who hold their farms by one tenure, namely: deeds of bargain and sale, from the Pattawatainy, Ottawa, and Chippewa chiefs, executed in the years 1781. 1785, and 178G. The purchasers have been in actual possession since that time. Their farms contain, variously, from one hundred to four hundred French acres, each, fronting on the river, from two to six acres, and extending back from forty to one hundred and eighty, until they meet the swamps, on either side of the river, which serve as a rear boundary for all the farms. The lands about the mouth of this river are of little value, being too wet for any kind of culture. Those further up are of an excellent soil, producing from twenty-five to thirty bushels to the acre, of wheat, or other grain, in the like proportion. The farms are tolerably well improved, having comfortable dwelling houses, built of hewn logs, and, most generally, the necessary out houses, such as barns, stables, etc. _ Their orchards are yet young, but promise, in a few years, to be very productive. The inhabitants are Canadian French, with only three exceptions. Among these people disputes have frequently arisen relative to their titles; and those disputes have always terminated by an adjudication in favor of the oldest Indian deed. They are. considered as freeholders, and enjoy every privilege which appertains to a fee simple estate—a number of them holding offices under the territorial government. Sandy creek empties itself into the river Raisin but a few paces from its mouth, turning abruptly to the south, having before meandered in a direction nearly parallel with that river, about three miles northward. The settlement extends three miles, amounting in number of inhabitants to sixteen, who took possession of their farms in the year 1792, under purchases from Joseph Benack, who claimed the native right, since the year 1780. None of these farms exceed two hundred acres, specifying two, three, and four, in front of the creek, and from twenty-five to fifty back. The soil is much the same as that of the river Raisin—black, rich, and favorable to the production, of grass, hemp, Indian corn, and wheat. The improvements in this settlement are mean. The houses, or huts, are of such construction and workmanship as scarcely to shut out the inclemencies of the seasons. The people are all Canadians. Rocky river discharges itself into lake Erie, three miles north of river Raisin, and eight south of river Huron. It is a small winding stream, too shallow to admit the passage of the smallest boats. The soil here differs little from that already described in the adjacent country—black and fertile, though rather loo wet for the cultivation of wheat. It is timbered with elm, oak, hickoiy, and maple. At the mouth of this stream there is a safe harbor, formed by the projection into the lake of Point Raisin, on the one side, and Rocky Point on the other. The tenure by which these lands are held is derived from an Indian deed, executed by the chiefs, in the year 1786, to Francis Pepin. The conveyance extends thirty degrees on the margin of the lake, and runs back into the countryone hundred, pursuing the meanders of the river. Pepin sold his claim to George MacDougall, who. some years since, conveyed two-thirds of the tract to Meldrum & Parks, a mercantile house in Detroit, and, conjointly with them, has erected very valuable improvements. About half a mile above the mouth of the river they have a dwelling house, a distillery, and a merchant mill, with every necessary appendage for the convenient manufacfcory of wheat. These buildings are worth, on a moderate calculation, ten thousand dollars. The north side of this stream is claimed by Gabriel Godfroy, under an Indian deed in his possession, dated in the year 1788. The conveyance specifies the same quantity as was granted on the south side to Pepin. Godfroy has made little or no improvements. There are only two families who now are on the river, those being immediately engaged in the management of the mill and distillery. River Huron is eight miles north of Rocky river, and twelve north of the river Ecorce, and empties itself into lake Erie about four miles north of Detroit, or the strait. With respect to soil, there is a great degree of similarity throughout this part of the country; dark, or rather black, light, and, wherever, with few exceptions, it has been cultivated, productive. In these respects, none are superior to the lands on this river. They consist of extensive prairies, covered so closely with hazleand other shrubberies as to afford a pleasant shade to the delighted traveller, who cannot but take an agreeable interest in the beautiful sceneries by which he is surrounded. The river, though narrow, is navigable twenty miles for boats, and has a deep and gentle current. There is but one claim, which arises under an Indian deed, dated in the year 1794, purporting to be a conveyance to Gabriel Godfroy of four thousand five hundred acres of land, upon which tract he has placed a tenant, who lives near the river as a ferryman. The deed is signed by one chief only, and that without a witness. To a title the claimant can have no pretensions. ’ Ecorce, or Bark river, enters the strait eleven miles north of Huron, and eleven miles south of Detroit; as a channel of communication, presents but few advantages. The country is level, the soil rich, and sufficiently dry for any kind of cultivation. The grass and wheat are astonishingly luxuriant, and nature requires to be but little aided to produce in abundance ail the necessaries of life; yet the people are poor beyond conception, and nodescription could give an adequate idea of their sen ile and degraded situation. They are sixteen in number, principally Canadian French, and hold from one to three hundred French acres of land each. Six of these farms were settled in the years 1792, 1794, and 1797, without any kind of authority. The others were purchased from the Indians in the year 1776, by Peter F. Comb, and settled soon afterwards. This appears to be the tenure by which they now hold them. The different claims were, at one time, confused and complicated, but one or two adjudications have settled the principle confirmatory of those titles held under P. Comb. In the territory these people are considered as freeholders, and enjoy the appurtenant privileges. River Rouge, so called from its reddish appearance, is four miles north of Ecorce, and six south of the town of Detroit. It is navigable six and eight miles for boats, and three for vessels of 150 tons burthen. Narrow, winding, and almost stagnant, the current of this river is so gentle as to be scarcely observable. It has, at all times, the complexion and appearance of a pool, and its exhalations in the summer months are extremely unhealthful. The ague and fever are in these seasons very prevalent, and fevers, sometimes of a more malignant nature, confine whole families to their beds for weeks together. It is only on the south side of this river that the lands are fertile. The soil is such as has been so frequently described in the rich parts of the neighboring country. ^ On the north side it is poor, grey, sandy, and unproductive. The settlements extend eight miles on both sides of the river, and the same order is observed in laying off their farms as has been noticed on river Raisin and Otter creek. Few or none of these exceed four hundred acres, and generally fall short of that quantity. No disputes, and few misunderstandings, have taken place with respect to boundaries, as those lines extend collaterally from the river, forming each tract into a regular parallelogram. The total amount of these are forty-three, five of which were entered on and improved, without authority, in the year 1798. The claims to all the others arise from a transference of the native right in the year 1780, at which time they were generally settled. The majority of the people arc Canadian French, and better informed than those on the river Ecorce. They can have no legal title. Settlements from river Dottge to the town of Detroit.—The strait by which the waters of the upper lakes discharge themselves into lake Erie, is thirty computed miles from the latter to lake Sinclair. Few rivers in the United States can vie in beauty and convenience of navigation with this- pleasant and valuable stream. It is about three-fourths of a mile broad, and generally, in the channel, four or five fathoms in depth. The detached settlements on its banks, and in its neighborhood, have been already noticed as high up as Rouge, or Red river, two miles above the mouth of which, the country begins to assume the appearance of connexion, regularly and continued improvement. There are twenty-three farms, all of which are at this time occupied. The scarcity of springs throughout this country, has compelled the people to bound their farms, in part, by some water course, and their dwelling houses arc, of necessity, erected on the banks of the streams. The farmers here are not an exception from this general practice. The lateral boundary lines extend forty, sixty, and sometimes one hundred miles back, and no tract contains more than four hundred acres. ; The soil was originally good, though it lias been much impoverished, and its strength, in some instances, entirely exhausted, from many years inattentive cultivation. Most of the farmers have been assiduously careful ill the rearing of fruit trees. Their apple orchards are generally well enclosed with pickets, and produce fruit and cider in sufficient abundance for the consumption of the country, and even for the supply of many of the Canadian settlements, to which they are exported. The houses and out houses are tolerably good; and, although the country is level, the height of the banks affords a commanding prospect, for several miles, ot the river and its borders. The titles to land in this settlement are variously founded. Three are derived from grants of the Marquis de Quesne, French Governor commandant of Louisiana and the Canadas in the year 17-10; ten from the Marquis de la Jouevire, vested with the like powers in the year 1750; seven from Indian deeds of gift in the year 1771, and confirmed in the year 1772 by the lion. Henry Bassett, a British officer, at that time commanding the fort; and the native right to three was conveyed by the Indians in the year 1780. It is unprecedented, and I should conceive (hat none of those commandants could have had any legal right to convey lands to individuals, consequently, their titles were originally bad. However, the length of their possession, and that being peaceable, too, will no doubt vest them with a fee simple. Those who hold simply from the Indians, stand upon grounds somewhat questionable. The town of Detroit.—The charter, w Iiich is for fifteen* acres square, was granted in the time of Louis XIY. of France, aiul is now, from the best information I have been able to collect, at Quebec: of those two hundred and i twenty-five acres, only four are occupied by the town and fort Lenault; the remainder isa common, except twenty-four, which were added twenty years ago to a farm belonging to William Macomb. As to the titles to the lots in town, 1 should conceive that the citizens might legally claim, from a length of undisturbed and peaceable possession, even in the absence of a inure valid and substantial tenure. Several of those lots are held by the commanding officer, as appendages of the garrison. A. stockade encloses the town, fort, and citadel; the pickets, as well as the-public houses, are in a state of gradual decay, and in a few years, without repairs, they must fall.to the ground. The streets are narrow, straight, regular, and intersect each other at right angles. The houses are, for the most part, low and inelegant, and although many of them arc convenient, and suited to the occupations of the people, there are perhaps a majority of them which require very considerable reparation. Gros Isle is generally a mile wide, and nine miles in length., running parallel w'ith the western or United States bank, to which it approaches more nearly than to the other. Its lower end extends to the mouth of the strait, where it discharges itself into Lake Erie, and is immediately opposite Malden, the British garrison at Anihcrstburg. This island is now cultivated by ten farmers, who pay an annual rent to the estate of William Macomb, by whom it was purchased of the Indians in the year 177(5, and settled at that time, or soon afterwards. The height of the situation, the richness of the soil, the quantity of valuable timber, consisting of oak anil hickory, with which it abounds, together with its nearness to market, obliges me to believe that it is a spot holding forth as many advantages as any other in this country. Adjacent to thi-. lies Stony Island, held by the same tenure, it is nearly one mile in length, and a third of a mile broad, and rendered of value only by a quarry of lime-stone, which affords the estate of Macomb a very considerable yearly income, independently of the lime. This island is of no consideration; it has but little timber, and is remarkable for a poverty of soil, which unfits it for cultivation. Hog Island is situated in the strait, three miles above the town, on the United States’ side of the channel, and contains, by estimation, three thousand five hundred acres of land. The poverty of the soil renders it of but little value to private persons; but, as public property, 1 should conceive it a spot of great national importance, and highly eligible for a garrison, as the elevation of its western end has a complete command of the river. It was formerly held as an apppendage of the garrison, and by the different commandants at Detroit lor cutting fire-wood and for pasturage. 'Flic oldest and best informed inhabitants of this place have assured me. that it was chartered with the rown of Delimit, and held by the garrison until the year 17(55, at which time it was purchased of the Indians by George McDougall, whose heirs, in the year 1786, sold it to William Macomb, in whose possession, or in the possession of his representatives, it lias since that time remained. Having considered and reported the situation of lands settled in this country, south and southwest of the town of Detroit, and made some hasty remarks on the town itself, I shall proceed to the settlements above. They extend themselves from the town to Gros Point, at the outlet of Lake Sinclair, into the strait, from thence, on the borders of said lake to Milk river; they then become detached and irregular, as high up as the river Sinclair, through which Lake Huron discharges itself. I shall observe those divisions in order to give you a more clear and distinct know-1 edge of the country upon which those settlements Dive been made. Settlements on the Strait from the town to Gros Point.—The distance is nine miles, and contains sixty farms, all of which are at this time occupied. They are, for the most part, two acres in front, hy forty deep, and laid out in the same parallel order as has been already remarked in all the other settlements. The situation of these lands is low, and very unhealthy, owing to a wide marsh, which extends several miles on the strait. The soil is impoverished, and produces but little; the buildings, which were once comparatively of the better kind, are now in a state of rapid decline. On traversing this settlement, no emotions of pleasure are experienced, except of that gloomy kind which arc exerted by the,contemplation of a ruin. The claims to lands here are similar to those below the town, viz. transfers of the native right to individuals, and confirmations of those transfers by the French commandants. in the years 1710, 1750, and 1757. I have already expressed my opinion in relation to the original invalidity of these claims, and the subsequent title acquired by length of undisturbed possession, together with the respectable light in which they were received by the British Government. The people arc Canadians, with few exceptions. Settlement on Lake Sinclair from Gros Point to Jli/k Diver.—This settlement is six miles iu length, and contains twenty four farms; with a front on the lake of from three to live acres, and an extent back ot forty acres. The face of the country is level, though the situation is high and commanding, and possesses, from its elevation, a pleasant and extensive view of Lake Sinclair, and its banks. The soil is dark, rich, and strong, and extremely favorable to the cultivation of wheat. Art here has done but little, and even less than the little which nature had left her to do: for the Canadian settlers are very indolent, of course very poor, and consequently very wretched. Perhaps, on a barren soil, necessity wouhl have been ail incitement to industry, the natural or rather the legitimate parent, of affluence. The tenures by which these people hold their farms, are of two kinds. Four of them may be denominated French titles. The remaining twenty are derived from the Indians, perhaps by purchase in the year 1783, at which time they were settled. * Palpable error in the original, which the printers have not the means of correcting. 760 / INDIAN AFFAIRS. [1809. Settlement from Milk river to river Huron.—Milk river is so inconsiderable a rivulet, and rendered, from its particular situation, so very unimportant, that I shall not waste my time, nor tire your patience* with its description. From its mouth to river Huron is twelve miles; less calculated for a settlement than any other I have seen in this country. It is low, flat, and marshy. These disadvantages, combined with itsnnhealthful effluvia, form obstacles which neither the industry nor perseverance of the agriculturist will be able to surmount. There are, nevertheless, thirty settlers on this tract, notwithstanding its apparent destitution of the advantages of soil, situation, and market. These people came into possession in the year 1797, without authority even from the Indians. Their divisional lines are marked by themselves, and they are ignorant of the number of acres contained in the respective farms. This settlement, however, possesses that regularity which is so 'remarkable in this country. The farmers are as poor, as they are unfortunate in the choice of their situation. All of them are Canadians. The river Huron is discharged into Lake Sinclair, twenty seven miles above Detroit, and eighteen above,the strait. The sameness observable in many parts of this country, compels me to fall into a monotony of expression which will be to you fatiguing. Yet simple truth must be preferred to every other consideration. The river is a narrow, gentle stream, navigable for boats thirty miles above its mouth. The settlements extend up the river nine miles, and contain thirty four families in present occupancy, laid off as those on the river Raisin, with this difference, that they have by survey no fixed or determinate rear boundaries} each tract extending back from the river or front boundary to a bog, at the distance of forty or fifty acres. This land is level, and the soil is dark and rich, laboring under no inconvenience from too great a quantity of water. It is tolerably well timbered. Hickory, oak, and elm, are most observable. Some of the people are agreeably situated} but, in general, they are poor in the extreme, owing to that indolence, and want of skill in agriculture, which so conspicuously marks the Canadian character in this country. All the settlers are of this description, except four, who are Englishmen of industry and enterprise. Twenty of these farms were purchased of the Indians, and settled in the year 1788. Ten in the years 1793, 1795, and 1796, and four in the year 1800, without authority of any kind. From the river Huron to Sinclair river, the distance, following the circuitous margin of the lake, is fifteen miles; with respect to the intermediate space, it may be necessary to make some observations. The first and most important subject, relative to the interest of the United States, is a salt spring, on a small stream, four miles east of river Huron, and three miles up the said stream from the lake. From experiments which have been made, I am justified in saying, that this spring deserves the public attention. It was wrought some, time by a couple of men, who, owing to their want of capital, were incapable of conducting the business on an advantageous plan. By these men I have been assured that a quart of water did, with them, turn out one gill of salt, and in all their trials with greater quantities, it never failed to produce in the like proportion. There is a sufficient quantity of water for the supply of ivorks to any extent. It is scarcely necessary to observe, that this spring is claimed by a mercantile house, under the firm of Meldrum and Parks; the particulars of which claim I considered as unworthy of investigation, well knowing that it must have been recently obtained from the Indians. The lands about the spring are rich, and favorable for tillage; particularly for the cultivation of wheat. Those extending to the moulh of the river Sinclair are rather too low and marshy. Two Canadian families have, notwithstanding, settled on them, who took possession of the spots they respectively occupy in the year 1801. Point O'Tramble— From the mouth of the river St. Clair, six miles up, are twelve farms, that front the river in the usual manner, from three to four and five acres, and forty back, none exceeding, in quantity, two hundred and forty. This land differs from the face of this country generally; its soil possesses every mark of poverty, sandy, and low in the extreme. Nothing exists to recommend this settlement, except its bordering on one of the most delightful rivers in the Western world. The only pretensions these people have to their farms; are derived from a simple possession, taken obtrusively, in the years 1780, 1785, and 1790. They are all Canadians. From this settlement, for twelve miles up the river, not a vestige of a house can be seen, owing, 1 suppose, to its being, for that distance, a perfect barren, when you are suddenly and agreeably surprised with the presentation of a number of fertile and well improved farms, edging the river for the extent of ten miles, to the amount of twenty-five farms, now under cultivation, and laid off on the river as other settlements in this country, with this difference, that the claimants extend their farms ten and twenty acres in front of the river, and, in two instances, from forty-five to fifty, all running back to one rear line, which is, by survey, forty acres. Three thousand seven hundred and fifty-nine acres of this land was purchased of the Indians, by Patrick Sinclair, British commandant at fort Sinclair, in the year 1765, who held it until the year 1782; during that time, deriving from it considerable profit as a pinery. In the year 1782, he left this country, and gave it, by deed of gift, to a Canadian, by the name of Votieur, who sold it in the year 1784, by the auctioneer, at public sale, at which time Meldrum and Park, a mercantile house of this country, became the purchasers, who have, since that period, claimed it as their property, and erected upon it valuable improvements; there are, notwithstanding, five farmers upon it, besides the tenant of Meldrum and Parks, who forcibly settled the farms they severally occupy, in the year 1800; the other nineteen farmers claim under Indian deeds, in the years 1780 and 1782. The river Sinclair is, in length, forty-five miles, and, in beauty, and convenience of navigation, preferable to Detroit, though it is not quite as wide. Such is its transparency, that the eye can distinguish at its bottom, in fifteen feet water, the most minute object; in it there are no shoals, and, in depth, generally, five and six fathoms.
