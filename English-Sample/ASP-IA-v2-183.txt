NO. 183.	[1st SESSION. ACCOUNTS OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS OF INDIAN AFFAIRS IN MICHIGAN AND MISSOURI. COMMUNICATEI/TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, FEBRUARY 11, 1822. SIR:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, February 9, 1822. In compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 18th ultimo, directing the Secretary of War “to lay before that House a copy of the account current of the Governor of the Michigan Territory, which shall exhibit a perfect view of his superintendency of Indian affairs for the year 1820, and, as far as in his power, the account of said superintendency for the year 1821, specifying the particular items of expenditure, and to whom paid; and, also, a similar account for said years of the superintendency of the Governor of the late Territory of Missouri,” I have the honor to enclose the report of the Second Auditor of the Treasury, which contains the information requested. It is proper to observe that the amount of presents mado to the Indians by the superintendent for the year 1820 was very considerably increased by the treaty of Saginaw, which acquired for the Government a very extensive and valuable tract of country around the bay of that name. No appropriation having been made for the expenses of holding the treaty, they were paid out of the ordinary appropriation for the Indian Department, of which a very considerable portion is blended with the current account of the expenditure of the year, under the head of “contingent services or presents,” uf which some of the considerable items, particularly for horses as presents to the Indians, are connected with the treaty, the presents being given either to prepare the way for a successful issue of the treaty, er to fulfil promises which were made while holding it. The objects of the tour of Governor Cass, in 1820, which constitutes a portion of the expenditure for that year, will appear by a reference to the correspondence with him in relation to it, a copy of which accompanies the report of the Second Auditor, as part of the vouchers for the settlement of his account. The various tribes of Indians within his superintendency between the lakes and the Mississippi, and the country itself, were but imperfectly known, and the principal objects of the tour were to obtain a more thorough knowledge of the character of both, and to make known to those tribes the policy and feelings of the Government towards them, in order to improve the ordinary administration of the department, and to carry into effect the system of measures which had been adopted in relation to the intercourse between them and the adjoining province of Canada. The measures which were then contemplated are particularly stated in my letter to the chairman of the Military Committee, dated 29th December, 1819, contained in a report of the Military Committee of the 3d January, 1820, to which I would respectfully refer the House. In addition to these, there were other objects, which, though of minor consequence, were not without interest. It was thought to be expedient to extinguish the Indian title to the islands in the vicinity of Michilimackinac, containing extensive quarries of plaster of Paris, and to a military site on the Sault de St. Marie, and to ascertain whether the Indian title had been extinguished to the country in and about the settlements at Green Bay and Prairie du Chien. These objects were considered of sufficient importance to authorize the tour; and, in order to obtain as full information as was practicable of a region so little known, two officers of the army and an enterprising and enlightened mineralogist were attached to the party. The expenses of the tour were charged to the appropriation for the Indian department, as its objects were connected with our relations with the Indians, and were taken principally out of the sum which, in the general distribution of the appropriation, had been allotted to that superintendency. Governor Cass received no additional compensation, and the officers of the army were allowed only the usual compensation of officers of their grade while engaged in the performance of topographical duties. The mineralogist was allowed $1 50 per diem for the time actually engaged, comprehending that employed in completing his report. The whole expenses of the tour, including presents, and the expenses of holding the treaties to which I have referred, and by which important cessions were obtained, amount to $6,318 02. It became necessary, while Governor Cass was at the seat of Government last autumn, in settling his account as superintendent, to adjust his personal account against the Government, which had remained open from the date of his appointment. In 1814 and 1815, shortly after he received his appointment, he made application for the allowance of a specific sum to cover the various personal expenses to which he was liable in the performance of his duty as superintendent. Without objecting to the amount which he thought necessary for that purpose, he was informed that a specific amount could not be allowed; but at the same time it was stated that, on presenting his account, what was reasonable would be allowed. The claim, from its nature, could only be adjusted on equitable principles, it being impossible to state the items of expense to which, situated as he was, he was exposed from his intercourse with the Indians. The facts and statement on which the decision was made, with the decision itself, accompany his accounts and will be found in the abstract of the vouchers in the report of the Second Auditor. The duties which Governor Cass performed as superintendent, being similar to thuse of Governor Clark, but more extensive, and, in their performance, attended with greater expense, in the adjustment of his account reference was had to the allowance which had been made to the latter, making such additional allowance as the difference in the two cases and a regard to equity required. The Governors of Territories are, by law, superintendents of Indian affairs within the Territory, whose duties extend to a general control over the agents and other officers of the Indian Department within the Territory, but do not extend to the performance of the duties assigned to agents, nor to the disbursements on account of the expenses of the department within the superintendency. These latter duties, as well as the former, having been assigned to Governor Clark, he was allowed, by the direction of General Armstrong, 1,500 dollars per annum for their performance, and the expense attending the same. The duties of Governor Cass have been equally extended beyond those belonging to him as superintendent. There being no agent within the peninsula of Michigan, the duties of an agent to the tribes residing within its limits necessarily devolved on him; and the disbursements of his superintendency (to which the agencies in Ohio and Indiana, with the exception of that at Vincennes, were annexed, as it was found tp be inconvenient to separate them from the same general control which, as superintendent, he had over the Indians in that quarter) were made through him. Under these circumstances, it was thought just to extend the decision which had heen made in the case of Governor Clark to Governor Cass; to which was added an allowance, supposed to be equal to the expense necessarily attending the intercourse with the Indians at a point to which there is so great a resort of Indians as Detroit, and where, from th.e neighborhood of the adjoining province of Canada, it is necessary to extend to them greater liberality and attention than at any other place. I have the honor to be your obedient servant,	J. C. CALHOUN. Hon. PHILIP P. BARBOUR, Speaker of the House of Representatives. SIR:	TREASURY DEPARTMENT, SECOND AUDITOR’S OFFICE, February 9, 1822. In obedience to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 18th ultimo, requiring the Secretary of War to lay before the House “a copy of the account current of the Governor of the Michigan Territory, which shall exhibit a perfect view of his superintendency of Indian affairs for the year 1820, and, as far as in bis power, the account of the said superintendency for the year 1821,spccifyingthe particular items of expenditure, and to whom paid; and, also, a similar account for said years, of the superintendency of the Governor of the late Territory of Missouri,” I have the honor to transmit, herewith, the statements desired; and, deeming it to be the object of the resolution that all information tending to elucidate the several items embraced by the general accounts current should accompany tho same, detailed abstracts of every voucher, and of each particular item of expenditure, with copies of various letters and certificates touching the same, as well as copies of the subordinate accounts composing, under different heads of appropriation, the general accounts current, are also herewith transmitted, together with a schedule of the same.

C. No. 3. SIR:	WASHINGTON, October 17, 1821. Some time since I submitted to the War Department the peculiarity of my situation as superintendent of Indian affairs, and the increased expense to which I was rendered liable by my local position and by the circumstances of the times. The letters which I had the honor to submit, of October 25th, 1814, and of October 21st, 1815, were in answer to these representations. It becomes my duty now, when requesting a definite allowance under these instructions, to state the circumstances which render this measure proper, that you may be the better enabled to determine what sums shall be allowed. During the whole period of the war, and for more than two years succeeding its termination, the Territory of Michigan was in a state of absolute exhaustion. The events there were at first so disastrous, and the contest for the possession of the country was so long and severe, that its resources were soon destroyed. Its reduced population, totally inadequate to the production of its own supplies, were dispirited, and their exertions paralyzed by the insecurity of their situation, and by the atrocious scenes of which they were the daily witnesses. Under these circumstances, it can excite no surprise to learn that every article of life was dearer than in any other section of the United States. The most extravagant prices were asked and given. I take the liberty of enclosing, herewith, a schedule of the prices, made out in 1815, while Governor Harrison, General McArthur, and Mr. Graham, commissioners for treating with the Indians, were at Detroit. The original was formed in the presence of Mr’ Graham, and transmitted by him to the War Department. It may be readily presumed that, upon such a frontier, and in such times, my expenses must have far exceeded the stated salary of the office. I can solemnly aver that I expended much more than the whole sum received as salary. After the communications before referred to, I considered myself justifiable in incurring these expenses, to which I was rendered liable, and from which I could not extricate myself without a sacrifice, in some degree, of the public interest. It is impossible to attain absolute precision upon such a subject. I have charged in my accounts with the United States $2,000 per annum, during the years 1814, 1815, and 1816; and certain I am that this sum will not compensate me for the peculiar circumstances in which I was placed, and for the additional' expense I was compelled to encounter. These three years comprehend the period to which I am willing that this allowance should be restricted, and within which the prices of every article were most extravagant. The expenditure of the appropriation for the Indian Department is entirely discretionary with the Government. It is applied to such objects, and in such manner, as the Government may deem most conducive to the public interest. There is no limitation but the discretion of the Executive—a discretion founded on a full consideration of the circumstances in every particular case, and restrained by the public interest on one side, and by the just rights of individuals on the other. I do not ask the sum which I have stated as a fixed annual allowance, but as a fair estimate of my claim under the authority of the Government. I do not ask it to be paid to me; I request it may be allowed in my account current as an item of expenditure to which I was liable. During the three years I have specified, Detroit was, emphatically, the Indian head-quarters. The eyes of all the Indians north of the Ohio and east of the Mississippi, together with many of those west of that river, were fixed upon that place. Either as actors or as anxious spectators, their attention was directed to Detroit and to Malden. All who could come—men, women, and children—remained as near there as the circumstances of the times permitted. During a part of that time we had no agent at Michilimackinac, Green Bay, Prairie du Chien, St. Peter’s, Rocky river, Chicago, Fort Wayne, and Upper Sanduskyr-and, during the whole of it, we had agents but at two or three of those places.	'The Governors of Territories are ez officio superintendents of Indian affairs within their respective local jurisdictions. But almost the whole duties of Indian agent for that immense extent of country, and for those numerous tribes of Indians, devolved upon me. Three-fourths of them were not within my local jurisdiction, and, consequently, I was not bound to discharge the duties of agent without compensation. In an estimate submitted to the War Department in 1816, it was computed that the average daily number of Indians in the town of Detroit was 400. My family has been driven front one extremity of the house to the other by them. There is another consideration, too, which ought not to be omitted. I was, by the execution of these duties, subjected to great personal responsibility. The money for the public expenditures of the department was procured by me in the interior of the country, and brought through that dangerous and exposed frontier, at my risk, to Detroit. An accident, by which the sum of $475 was lost, might easily have happened to a much larger amount, and would have occasioned my inevitable ruin. More than $200,000 were, within this period, thus expended by me, not one cent of which was it my legal duty to disburse. My claim, then, rests upon these facts: Upon the assurances of the War Department, contained in the letters I have before mentioned; upon services rendered by me in cases not within the legal scope of my duties; upon the disbursements of public money under the circumstances which I have staled. I reserve for your subsequent consideration any claim which I may have to an allowance for the discharge of duties since 1816, similar in their character to those alluded to by Mr. Graham, in his letter respecting the settlement of the accounts of General Hull. The sum of $2,000 per annum includes all allowances in whatever form which I claim for the years 1814, ’15, and ’16, and all that I ever expect to claim at any time under the letters of the War Department to which I have referred. The estimate upon this subject should be judged by the circumstances of the times when the facts occurred, and not by our present views of things. It was a period of war, of a peace which immediately succeeded to it. Every thing was upon the war scale. We have reached our present situation slowly and gradually. We must stop and look back before we can correctly appreciate the changes which have taken place. There are in town two gentlemen. Colonel Hunt and General Macomb, one of whom was at Detroit during the whole period to which I have referred, and the other during a part of it. 1 have not exchanged a word with either of them upon the subject of this letter. I beg leave to refer you. to them for such facts as may be material in enabling you to form your opinion upon the estimate which I have submitted. I can only add, that I have incurred heavy expenses necessarily incident to my station; and I do trust that I shall receive credit for the assertion when I say, which I do most solemnly, that my pecuniary circumstances would have been better had I never accepted the office which I now hold. Very respectfully, sir, I have the honor to be, &c. LEWIS CASS. Hon. JOHN C. CALHOUN, Secretary of War. P. S. I find, on examination, that the schedule referred to cannot now be found in the department. Another shall be made out, should you deem it important. L. C. L. C. No. 4. SIR:	WASHINGTON, October 29, 1821. In the letter which I had the honor to address you a few days since, I stated the nature of the claim which I had to compensation for the execution of duties connected with Indian affairs, and which I was not required by law to execute. In addition to the facts and principles therein stated, I take the liberty of presenting the following view of the subject. I am ez officio superintendent of Indian affairs within the Territory of Michigan. As such, it is my duty to superintend the agencies therein. Further than this, the law does not require me to go. Whenever, therefore, other duties are executed, they are to be paid out of the general fund appropriated for Indian affairs. Since 1813, and including part of that year, I have been the superintendent of Indian affairs upon the northwestern frontier of the United States. The agency of Michilimackinac is the only agency that was originally within the Territory of Michigan. That of Green Bay was attached to the Territory at the close of 1818, or the commencement of 1819. All the others under my superintendency are without the Territory, and the supervising power exercised by me over them is consequently not within the pale of my official duties. I have, then, superintended the following agencies, for which I have a just claim to compensation: the agency of Green Bay, till 1819; the agency at Chicago, Fort Wayne, Piqua, and the sub-agencies at Upper Sandusky and Blanchard’s Fork, since their establishment. In the settlement of the accounts of Governor Hull, in 1811, he was allowed $250 per annum for superintending the Indians at Upper Sandusky. The Indians superintended by me are, I presume, more than ten times in number those included in his account. Besides, the business then was comparatively trifling to what it now is. The correspondence of the War Department with the agencies is now carried on through the superintendent. Every doubtful point is submitted to him by the different agents. If the question can be decided by him, a decision is made; if not, it is referred to the War Department. All the funds received by him are transmitted to the different agents. The estimates are forwarded by him, and every voucher for expenditure by an agent is examined, certified, and transmitted by him, and an account kept with each agent in his office. Previous to the war, no such system prevailed; and the consequence was, a general laxity in the state of our Indian affairs. Scarcely any correspondence was carried on between the superintendent and the agents, except with relation to the issuing of licenses, for each of which the superintendent received $5. All the forms, also, are devised by me, and forwarded to the agents. I have no hesitation in saying that my duties, in this respect, are three-fold greater than those which I am required to execute in the civil administration of the government of the Territory. I have before stated that I am ez officio superintendent of Indian affairs within the Territory, and that it is my duty as such to “ oversee and overlook,” in the words of the definition, others in the department. But for eight years’I have executed the duty of Indian agent at Detroit. There was no agent “ to oversee and overlook.” I came directly in contact with the Indians, and every question and every application respecting them came directly to me. In fact, I have been surrounded by them. Some conception of their number may be formed, when it is recollected that the great body of the Indians north of the Ohio and east of the Mississippi annually visit Malden, and pass through, or in the vicinity of, Detroit, on their journeys. That place has, for more than a century, been the head-quarters of Indian affairs, under the French, British, and American Governments. The Ottawas, Chippewas, and a large portion of the Pattawatamies, belong to that agency, considered as such; and of these tribes I am in fact the agent. All the provisions and presents are issued by me: the annuities are paid by me. Applications with respect to losses sustained, either by the Indians or by our own citizens, are made to me, heard, determined, and satisfied or rejected, or forwarded to the Second Auditor of the Treasury. Licenses both to our own citizens in the ordinary manner, and also under the act of 1816, are granted by me; and the latter is a troublesome and laborious duty, for the discharge of which Major Puthuff considered himself entitled to $3,000 in one year; in short, the daily and hourly duties devolving upon an ordinary Indian agent, and resulting from the visits and applications of an importunate, hungry, wretched, and generally drunken people, are performed by me, not only for the Indians living within the peninsula, and considered as belonging to the Detroit agency, and computed at 8,000, but also for every Indian without those limits who is brought to Malden and Detroit by business, interest, or poverty. Considered with reference to its business and importance, and taking into view its relation to the British and Indians, there is certainly no agency in the Union which can compare with that of Detroit; none which is visited by the same number of Indians, none which is importuned with the same number of applications, none which requires the same ceaseless attention, and none which- renders necessary the same caution and vigilance to secure the Indians from the effect of British presents and promises. The duties of this agency I have performed for upwards of eight years, without any legal obligation, without one cent of compensation, and with as much zeal and fidelity as in my power. I have not the means of .ascertaining, with precision, the sums that have passed through my hands in the period above alluded to; they must, however, equal $400,000. No law requires me to receive or disburse one cent of this money. During a considerable part of the time it was procured at the banks in Ohio, and brought at my risk to Detroit. The risk attending these transactions was of two kinds: 1st, That of transportation; two hundred miles of the whole distance being unsettled. War prevailed during part of the time, and at no time was the country considered safe. The road traversed the Black swamp, perhaps the most dreary portion of the Union. I have already stated the loss of $475, and the same accident might have happened to almost any amount. A sudden fall of rain might cause a creek to rise, and might lead to the death of the messenger. 2d. Another risk was occasioned by the state of the currency and the uncertain condition of the banks. These institutions are in a critical situation, fluctuating with every report; solvent to-day, and bankrupt to-morrow. To procure the money, I gave drafts on the Treasury. These drafts were, of course, debited to me; but, between the time of receiving and of paying the money, the bank might shut its vaults, and the paper thus become useless; in such an event, the loss must fall upon me. Even in better and safer times, the Bank of Michigan considered it worth 1J per cent, to bring money from New York at the expense of the United States, and, in fact, refused to do it. The mode of expending this money renders the business very hazardous to the officer. A voucher may be lost or mislaid, or a payment may be made not authorized by law or by the instructions; and, in these cases, certain loss is the consequence. The payments, too, are of the most troublesome kind. A thousand little articles are required by the Indians, and the accounts must be multiplied in proportion. A portion of this amount consisted in goods sent for distribution to the Indians—the most perplexing business which ever fell to the lot of any man to execute. Day after day, month after month, and year after year, to hear their demands, their complaints of partialities, and to divide and satisfy, require a greater share of patience than is usually found. I cannot add any thing to my former statement on the subject of expense; but I take the liberty of subjoining the certificates of General Macomb and Colonel Hunt, two gentlemen who have observed at all times my official duties, and who well know the situation in which I have been placed. I trust their statement will be satisfactory. I take the liberty of transmitting, also, a condensed exhibit of my claim, certified by myself. Yours, &c. LEWIS CASS. Hon. JOHN C. CALHOUN, Secretary of War.	• WASHINGTON, November 2, 1821. I do hereby certify that Whitmore Knaggs has'been a deputy superintendent of Indian affairs, or sub-agent and interpreter, as I have been informed, since General Wayne took possession of the fort of Detroit; Gabriel Godfroy was appointed to the same office in 1813, by General Harrison. Knaggs is the sub-agent for the Chippewas and Ottawas, and Godfroy for the Pattawatamies. Both of them speak all the Indian languages of that country fluently. They are men above the common sphere of interpreters, but can scarcely read or write; of course, they can render me no service in the execution of any of the duties which require the most limited education. It is their duty to attend all the Indian treaties, which they do, without compensation. They have attended the treaties of Spring .Wells, in 1815; of Fort Meigs, in 1817; the three treaties of St. Mary’s, in 1818; the treaty of Saginaw, in 1819; and the treaty of Chicago, in 1821. It is their duty, also, to repair to any part of the Indian country where difficulties may arise, to pursue and reclaim from marauding parties of Indians any property they may have stolen; to take the annuity to such part of the country as may be directed for the payment of Indians; to receive at their houses, which are never empty, all Indians who may arrive; to ascertain their business, feelings, &c.; and to attend to the drawing of provisions, apd an immense variety of business, the details of which it would be tedious to enumerate, and which employs their time, attention, and means. There has been no other sub-agent in the Territory since the period of my residence there, and both the persons I have mentioned have been zealous public servants, overloaded with duties, and not supported during any one year by their official emoluments. Charles Larned, John Stockton, and Robert A. Forsyth, have, since September, 1814, executed those duties which, at other places, are performed by sub-agents, and two of them the duties of interpreters. The first speaks French, and acted as French interpreter; and the last speaks that language, and also that of the Ottawas, Chippewas, and Pattawatamies, and acted as interpreter fortheir languages, All three of them aided me in the ordinary duties of the office, and without them it would have been impossible for me to discharge its duties. No other interpreter is now constantly employed except Forsyth and the, two sub-agents. Without the assistance of one of the persons last mentioned, a sub-agent or interpreter would have been necessary at all times in my office. LEWIS CASS. L. C. No. 5. •	WASHINGTON, October 30, 1821. I certify that I have lived at Detroit during the whole time that Governor Cass has administered the Government there. I have read with attention two letters addressed by him to the Secretary of War, one of October 17th, and the other of October 29th, 1821, and there is not one fact stated in either which I do not fully believe. It is only necessary for me to add, that his office is most troublesome and perplexing, and that the applications made to him by the Indians are almost hourly. Detroit has, since the commencement of the war, and until within two years, been the dearest place in the United States. Every article of life has been enormous. The average price of tlour has been twelve dollars per barrel, pork thirty-five per barrel, whiskey two dollars per gallon, butter fifty cents per pound by the firkin, eggs fifty cents per dozen by the average, and frequently a dollar has been paid per dozen for them; three dollars for a turkey, wine eight dollars per gallon, corn two dollars per bushel—I have paid that price for five hundred bushels at a time; oats seventy-five cents per bushel, hay thirty dollars per ton, loaf sugar fifty cents per pound, coffee sixty- two and a half cents per pound, hyson tea three dollars per pound, and every other article in proportion. The contract price of wood was, upon the average, five dollars and fifty cents per cord. Having been in the mercantile business during the whole time, I can speak of these subjects from my own knowledge. My expenditures during the period of Governor Cass’s administration have exceeded, upon an average, §2,000 per annum. From the frontier situation of Detroit, the necessary disbursements of an executive officer must be great, and I believe Governor Cass’s to have far exceeded that of any other citizen in the Territory. I am a director of the Bank of Michigan, and it is within my knowledge that the bank this summer refused to bring specie from New York to Detroit at the expense of the United States, but at their own, although the transaction would have been worth one and a half per cent. They considered the risk much greater. During most of the time stated by Governor Cass, I think it was very hazardous to bring money from almost any point, and I am satisfied that any insurance company in the world would have asked four per cent, for the hazard of bringing money to that place. I have attended every treaty which he has concluded with the Indians, and have observed, in common with other individuals there, his constant anxiety of mind, his unwearied exertions to bring the negotiations to a favorable issue, and his peculiar talent in effecting that object. HENRY J. HUNT. L. C. No. 6. SIR:	WASHINGTON, October 30, 1821. I have attentively read the statements of Governor Cass, as set forth in his two letters addressed to the honorable Secretary of War, dated October 17 and 29, 1821, and do unhesitatingly say that it is my opinion and belief that every fact and circumstance therein set forth is fair and not exaggerated; because, from my own experience, I found that my pay and emoluments as a major general commanding barely met the necessary expenses to which I was exposed while commanding at Detroit in 1815, 1816, 1817, and 1818. It was more like a foreign station than one within the limits of our own territory, where every article of living was exceedingly scarce, and, consequently, very dear. That it was also the rendezvous of the troops for the western lakes and for the Indians of lhe west, and, indeed, of almost every quarter; that to manage the savages with address, to secure their interest and friendship, it required more than ordinary attention, particularly as it was at the cluse of a war in which the Indians suffered a good deal. These unfortunate people, pressed to the greatest extremities, were calling constantly on the American and British authorities in the immediate vicinity of Detroit, the natural and ancient places of their resort. During this period, Governor Cass was surrounded with deputations and chiefs from all the tribes, both far and near; and to show them some of the civilities to which they were accustomed from the whites, required not only great pecuniary means, but a knowledge of their habits and manners, which the Governor appeared perfectly to understand. The zeal with which the Department of Indian Affairs was executed under the administration of Governor Cass, not only by his personal exertion, but the faculty he possessed of causing every one attached to his department to aid him, produced the most happy consequences. The Indians became daily more tractable, felt a higher respect and consideration for the American Government, and already began to contrast its character with that of the British, to whom they had been so warmly attached during the late war. But, to bring about this happy and good understanding, many feasts were given to the chiefs, and presents to their wives and children, from the hands of the Governor and liis family; many acts of kindness, such as feeding them within the enclosure of his domestic establishment, supplying the sick and relieving the needy, could not be accomplished without considerable expense—an expense which I was sure would be more than double his salary as Governor of the Territory of Michigan. To these facts I am perfectly knowing, because I often counselled with the Governor on the state of the Indians and of the Indian affairs, and was absolutely obliged to send a guard to the Governor’s quarters, in order to enable the Governor to prevent the Indians from pressing too hard upon him, so that he might be, in some degree, free from their incessant demands, and have time enough to attend to his public concerns, which were otherwise very urgent at that time. The manner in which the affairs of the civil department of his administration were conducted is publicly and well known; and here it may not be improper to remark, that this branch of his duty called around him many officers and others, both civil and military, and, consequently, a corresponding expense. The Indian Department was the most arduous and incessant concern of Governor Cass, because on the faithful administration of all its branches depended not only the peace and prosperity of the Territory over which he was appointed Governor, but the tranquillity and protection of all the frontier settlements of the west, from beyond the Mississippi to the frontier of Ohio. The result of his administration is well known to the War Department and to the nation at large, and is now felt and approved by many thousands who feel the influence of his useful exertions. I am, therefore, satisfied that his demand on the Government for some compensation for his extra duties in the Indian Department is not only reasonable and proper, but that his situation demands the relief which such extraordinary duties and expense entitle him to; and that I consider the sum asked for, viz. 2,000 dollars per annum, as nothing more than a reasonable compensation. ALEXANDER MACOMB, Major General. L. C. No. 7. Extract of a letter from the Secretary of War to Governor Cass, dated OCTOBER 24, 1814. The President, to whom your letter of the 15th September was submitted, is fully aware of the additional expense which you must necessarily incur by those attentions to the Indian chiefs and principal men which the existing state of affairs make indispensably necessary; but the mode pointed out by you, by which they might be covered, is such, he thinks, as neither the usage of the Government nor the law would justify. He, however, is of opinion that you should be remunerated for these additional expenses, either by a special appropriation, or out of the contingent fund of the Indian Department. L. C. No. 8. Extract of a letter from George Graham, chief clerk of the War Department, to Governor Cass, dated OCTOBER 21, 1815. Your letter of the 8th September has been submitted to the President, who has lately returned from a visit to his family residence. He has requested me to inform you that he considers the existing laws as presenting great obstacles to granting any fixed annual allowance, in addition to your salary as Governor and Indian agent, ex officio, of the Michigan Territory; but, aware of the additional expenses which you have been subjected to, from the peculiar state of the Territory since you have been acting as Governor, and desirous that you should be remunerated for them, he requests that you will submit an estimate of these additional expenses in the form of an account against the Government, which, in that shape, will be acted upon, and passed (if deemed reasonable) to the proper appropriation. On the last settlement made by Governor Hull with this Department, I find that an allowance was made to him of $750 for superintending, for the years 1809, ’10, ’ll, Indian agents not within the limits of the Michigan Territory. The agents for Green Bay and Chicago have both been directed to report to you. L. C. No. 9. NOVEMBER 2, 1821. In addition to the ten rations a day which have been allowed Governor Cass, on account of the great expense which has attended his intercourse with the Indians as superintendent, he will be allo'wed, in full of all expenses and charges for extra duty as superintendent, the same compensation as that which was made to Governor Clark; his expenses as superintendent and claims for extra services being considered equal to the amount allowed. C. Larned, John Stockton, and R. A. Forsyth, will be allowed at the rate of five hundred dollars per annum for performing the duties of sub-agents, and the last two hundred and twenty dollars per annum as interpreter, deducting the payments made to them above that sum from the allowance to Governor Cass as superintendent. The ration undrawn will be estimated at twenty cents per ration. JOHN C. CALHOUN. L. C. No. 10. Governor Cass's general certificate. NOVEMBER 9, 1821. I do hereby certify that the account of Mack & Conant was for various articles furnished for the use of the Indian Department, and which were employed for mechanical work, and for distribution to the Indians. The sum of $500, voucher 23, was paid upon the order of Major Puthuff, Indian agent at Michilimackinac, and was for articles furnished to that agency.	1 Voucher 51. This was the expense of transporting to Detroit the specie designed for annuities. The horses were generally purchased and given to the Indians in consequence of promises made to them at treaties. All that are charged in this account were so disposed of, or have strayed or perished in the public service. Voucher 48. This charge is for the sum of $500 paid Jacob Smith, an influential man among the Indians, for his services in the summer of 1819, in relation to the Saginaw treaty. Voucher 74. This charge is of the same nature. The charge of $800, for the charter of the schooner Decatur, was in consequence of the necessity of detaining that vessel at Saginaw, both as a storeship and to retransport to Detroit persons employed at the treaty, and such provisions and other articles as were not wanted there. From 12 to —. These charges are on account of the expedition to the sources of the Mississippi under my command, in 1820. So far as respects the other items in the abstracts, I certify that the money has been faithfully expended according to the best of my discretion, and that the articles purchased have been applied to the public service according to their nature and to the statements of their respective vouchers. LEWIS CASS, Governor of Michigan Territory. L. C. No. 11. SIR:	DETROIT, November 18,1819. The country upon the southern shore of Lake Superior, and upon the water communication between that lake and the Mississippi, has been but little explored, and its natural features are imperfectly known. We have no correct topographical delineation of it, and the little information we possess relating to it has been derived from the reports of the Indian traders. It has occurred to me that a tour through that country, with a view to examine the productions of its animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms, to explore its facilities for water communication, to delineate its natural objects, and to ascertain its present and future probable value, would not be uninteresting in itself, nor useless to the Government. Such an expedition would not be wholly unimportant in the public opinion, and would well accord with that zeal for inquiries of this nature which has recently marked the administration of the War Department. But, however interesting such a tour might be in itself, or however important in its result, either in a political or geographical point of view, I should not have ventured to suggest the subject, nor to solicit your permission to carry it into effect, were it not, in other respects, intimately connected with the discharge of my official duties. Mr. Woodbridge, the Delegate from this Territory, at my request, takes charge of this letter; and he is so intimately acquainted with the subject, and every way so competent to enter into any explanations you may require, that I shall not be compelled to go as much into detail as, under other circumstances, might be necessary. The route which I propose to take is from here to Michilimackinac, and from thence, by the Straits of St. Mary’s, to the river which contains the body of copper ore, (specimens of which have been transmitted to the Government,) and to the extremity of Lake Superior. , From that point, up the river which forms the water communication between that lake and the Mississippi, to the latter river; and by the way of Prairie du Chien and Green Bay, to Lake Michigan. The political objects which require attention upon this route are: 1st. A personal examination of the different Indian tribes who occupy the country; of their moral and social condition; of their feelings towards the United States; of their numerical strength; and of the various objects connected with them, of which humanity and sound policy require that the Government should possess an intimate knowledge. We are very little acquainted with these Indians, and I indulge the expectation that such a visit would be productive of beneficial effects. The extract from the letter of Colonel Leavenworth, herewith enclosed, and the speech of the Winnebago Indians, transmitted to the War Department by Mr. Graham, from Rock Island, February 24, 1819, will show how much we have yet to learn respecting these tribes, which are comparatively near to us. 2d. Another important object is to procure the extinction of Indian titles to the land in the vicinity of the Straits of St. Mary’s, Prairie du Chien, Green Bay, and upon the communication between the two latter places. I will not trouble you with any observations respecting the necessity of procuring these cessions. They are the prominent points of the country, the avenues of communication by which alone it can be approached. Two of them, Prairie du Chien and Green Bay, are occupied by a considerable population, and the Straits of St. Mary’s by a few families. The undefined nature of their rights and duties, and the uncertain tenure by which they hold their lands, render it important that some step should be taken by the Government to relieve them. I think, too, that a cession of territory, with a view to immediate sale and settlement, would be highly important in the event of any difficulties with the Indians. My experience at Indian treaties convinces me that reasonable cessions, upon proper terms, may at any time be procured. At the treaty recently concluded at Saginaw, the Indians were willing to cede the country in the vicinity of Michilimackinac, but I did not feel authorized to treat with them for it. Upon this subject, I transmit extracts from the letters of Mr. Boyd and Colonel Bowyer, by which it will be seen that these gentlemen anticipate no difficulty in procuring these cessions. 3d. Another important' object is the examination of the body of copper in the vicinity of Lake Superior. As early as the year 1800, Mr. Tracy, then a Senator from Connecticut, was despatched to make a similar examination. He, however, proceeded no farther than Michilimackinac. Since then, several attempts have been made, which have proved abortive. The specimens of virgin copper which have been sent to the seat of Government have been procured by the Indians, or by the half-breeds, from a large mass represented to weigh many tons, which has fallen from the brow of a hill. I anticipate no difficulty in reaching the spot, and it may be highly important to the Government to divide this mass, and to transport it to the seaboard for naval purposes. It is also important to examine the neighboring country, which is said to be rich in its mineral productions. I should propose that the land in the vicinity of this river be purchased of the Indians. It could doubtless be done upon reasonable terms, and the United States could then cause a complete examination of it to be made. Such a cession is not unimportant in another point of view. Some persons have already begun to indulge in speculations upon this subject. The place is remote, and the means of communicating with it are few. By timely presents to the Indians, illegal possession might be gained, and much injury might be done, much time might elapse, and much difficulty be experienced, before such trespassers could be removed. 4th. To ascertain the views of the Indians in the vicinity of Chicago respecting the removal of the Six Nations to that district of country, an extract from the letter of Mr. Kenzie, sub-agent at Chicago, upon this subject, will show the situation in which this business stands. 5th. To explain to the Indians the views of the Government respecting their intercourse with the British author ■'ties at Malden, and distinctly to announce to them that their visits must be discontinued. It is probable that the annunciation of the newsystem which you have directed to be pursued upon this subject, and the explanations connected with it, can be made with more effect by me than by ordinary messengers. 6th. To ascertain the state of the British fur trade within that part of our jurisdiction. Our information upon this subject is very limited, while its importance requires that it should be fully known. In addition to these objects, I think it very important to carry the flag of the United States into those remote regions, where it has never been borne by any person in a public station. The means by which I propose to accomplish this tour are simple and economical. All that will be required is an ordinary birch canoe, and permission to employ a competent nnmber of Canadian boatmen. The whole expense will be confined within narrow limits, and no appropriation will be necessary to defray it. I only request permission to assign to this object a small part of the sum apportioned for Indian expenditures at this place, say from 1,000 to 1,500 dollars. If, however, the Government should think that a small display of force might be proper, an additional canoe, to be manned with active soldiers, and commanded by an intelligent officer, would not increase the expense, and would give greater effect to any representations which might be made to the Indians. An intelligent officer of engineers, to make a correct chart for the information of the Government, would add to the value of the expedition.	’ I am not competent to speculate upon the natural history of the country through which we may pass. Should this object be deemed important, I request that some person acquainted with zoology, botany, and mineralogy may be sent to join me. It is almost useless to add that I do not expect any compensation for my own services, except the ordinaryallowance for negotiating Indian treaties, should you think proper to direct any to be held, and intrust the charge of them to me. I request that you will communicate to me, as early as convenient, your determination upon this subject, as it will be necessary to prepare a canoe during the winter, to be ready to enter upon the tour as soon as the navigation of the lakes is open, should you think proper to approve the plan. Very respectfully, &c. LEWIS CASS. Hon. JOHN C. CALHOUN, Secretary of War. L. C. No. 12. SIR:	DEPARTMENT OP WAR, January 14, 1820. I have received your letters of the 18th and 21st November last. The exploring tour you propose has the sanction of the Government, provided the expenditure can be made out of the sum allotted to your superintendency for Indian affairs, adding thereto one thousand dollars for that special purpose. The objects of this expedition are comprised under the six heads stated in your letter of the 18th November last, and which you will consider (with the exception of that part which relates to holding Indian treaties, upon which you will be fully instructed hereafter,) as forming a part of the instructions which may be given you by this Department. Should your reconnaissance extend to the western extremity of Lake Superior, you will ascertain the practicability of a communication between the Bad or Burntwood river, which empties into the lake, and the Copper or St. Croix, which empties into the Mississippi, and the facility they present for a communication with our post on the St. Peter’s. The Montreal rivers will also claim your attention, with a view of establishing through them a communication between Green Bay and the west end of Lake Superior. To aid you in the accomplishment of these important objects, some officers of the topographical engineers will be ordered to join you. Perhaps Major Long, now here, will be directed to take that route to join the expedition which he commands up the Missouri. In that event, a person acquainted with zoology, and botany, and mineralogy, will be selected to accompany him. Feeling, as I do, great interest in obtaining a correct topographical, geographical, and military survey of our country, every encouragement, consistent with the means in my power, will be given by this Department. To this end General Macomb will be ordered to afford you every facility you may require. I have, &c. His Excellency LEWIS CASS, Detroit.	J. C. CALHOUN. L. C. No. 13. SIR:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, February, 25, 1820. Mr. Schoolcraft, a gentleman of science and observation, and particularly skilled in mineralogy, has applied to me to be permitted to accompany you on your exploring tour on Lake Superior. I have directed him to report to you for that duty, under the belief that he will be highly useful to you, as well as serviceable to the Government and to the promotion of science. You will furnish him with the necessary supplies and accommodation while employed, and every facility necessary to enable him to obtain a knowledge of the mineralogy of the country, as far as practicable. I have, &c. His Excellency LEWIS CASS, Detroit.	J. C. CALHOUN. L. C. No. 14. Extract of a letter from the Secretary of War to Governor Lewis Cass, dated SIR:	APRIL 5, 1820. I have received your letters of the 10th, 11th, and 17th ultimo. In relation to procuring cessions of land from the Indians, the Government has decided that it would be inexpedient to obtain any further extinguishment of Indian title, except at the Sank de St. Marie, where it is the wish of the Department that an inconsiderable cession, not exceeding ten miles square, (unless strong reasons for a greater cession should present themselves from an actual inspection of the country,) should be acquired upon the most reasonable terms, so as to comprehend the proposed military position there. Herewith you will receive aplat of the country about the Sault de St. Marie, on which is indicated the military . site intended to be occupied for defence. You will also procure the cession of the islands containing plaster, provided these islands are clearly within the boundary of the United States, and can be obtained without any considerable expense. A commission authorizing you to hold these treaties will be forwarded to you in a few days. As it is desirable to know by what title the people at Green Bay and Prairie du Chien hold their lands, and whether or not the Indian titles to those lands were extinguished by the French, at any period subsequent to their possession of the country, (which is the impression of this Department,) you will communicate such information as you possess, or may obtain during your tour, on this subject. In addition to Mr. Schoolcraft, Captain Douglass, of the engineer corps, has been ordered to join you, and Mr. Whitney (in whose behalf application has been made for that purpose) may accompany you, if you can accommodate him. Should he accompany you, he will be allowed the same compensation made to Mr. Schoolcraft, who will be allowed one dollar and fifty cents a day for the time actually employed. L. C. No. 15.
