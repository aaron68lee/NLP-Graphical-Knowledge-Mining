Copy of the license granted to General William H. Ashley to trade with the Indians up the Missouri, dated April 11, 1822. To all who shall see these presents, greeting: Whereas William H. Ashley, of the State of Missouri, having made application to the Department of War for license to carry on trade with the Indians up the Missouri, and hath given bond, according to law, for the true and faithful observance, by him and his agents, of all and singular the regulations and restrictions as are, or shall be, made for the government of trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes: Now, therefore, be it known that the said William H. Ashley is hereby licensed to carry on trade with the Indians up the Missouri accordingly, for the term of one year from the date hereof, unless the license hereby granted should be sooner revoked. Given under my hand, and the seal of the War Office of the United States, at the city of Washington, this 11th day of April, in the year of our Lord 1822. By order of the President of the United States: J. C. CALHOUN. NOTE.—A license of precisely the same tenor and date was also granted to Major Andrew Henry. Extract of a letter from the Secretary of War to General William Clark, Superintendent of Indian Affairs at St. Louis, dated JULY 1, 1822. I have received a letter from Major O’Fallon, in which he states that he understands a license has been granted to General Ashley and Major Henry to trade, trap, and hunt on the Upper Missouri, and expresses a hope that limits bave been prescribed to their trapping and hunting on Indian lands, as, he says, nothing is better calculated to alarm and disturb the harmony so happily existing between us and the Indians in the vicinity of the Council Bluffs. The license which has been granted by this Department, by order of the President, to General Ashley and Major Henry, confers the privilege of trading with the Indians only, as the laws regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes do not contain any authority to issue licenses for any other purpose. The privilege thus granted to them they are to exercise conformably to the laws and regulations that are, or shall be, made for the government of trade and intercourse with the Indians: for the true and faithful performance of which they have given bonds, with sufficient security; consequently, it is presumed they will do no act, not authorized by such laws and regulations, which would disturb the peace and harmony existing between the Government and the Indians on the Missouri, but rather endeavor, by their regular and conciliatory conduct, to strengthen and confirm them. 18th CONGRESS.]
