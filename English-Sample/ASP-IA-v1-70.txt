No. 70. [1st Session. THE SEVEN NATIONS. COMMUNICATED TO THE SENATE, MAY 3, 1796. Gentlemen of the Senate: Sometime last year, Jeremiah Wadsworth was authorized to hold a treaty with the Cohnawaga Indians, styling themselves the Seven Nations of Canada, to enable the State of New York to extinguish, by purchase, a claim which the said Indians had set up to a parcel of land lying within that State. This negotiation having issued without effecting its object, and the State of New York having requested a renewal of the negotiation, and the Indians having come forward with an application on the same subject, I now nominate Jeremiah Wadsworth, to be a commissioner to hold a treaty-with the Cohnawaga Indians, styling themselves the Seven Nations of Canada- for tire purpose of enabling the State of New York to extinguish the"aforesaid claim. GEO. WASHINGTON. United States. May 2, 1796. 4th Congress.]
