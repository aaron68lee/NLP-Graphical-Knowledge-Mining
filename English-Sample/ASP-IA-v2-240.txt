NO. 240.	[1st SESSION. CONDITION OF THE INDIANS. COMMUNICATED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, MAY 20, 1826. Mr. COCKE, from the Committee on Indian Affairs, to whom the subject had been referred, made the following report:	< That, in discharge of the duties assigned them by the House of Representatives, they turned their attention to the vast intercourse between the United States and the several Indian tribes within and contiguous to the States and Territories of this Union. They see with regret the rapid decrease of the aborigines of America, which will, ere long, in the opinion of the committee, result in their total annihilation. To retard, if not completely prevent that occurrence, the committee, at an early period after their appointment, addressed a letter to the Secretary of War, requesting the views of the Government on this important and interesting subject. The answer to this request has been heretofore reported to the House, accompanied by a bill to carry into effect the objects recommended by that Department. The committee addressed a second letter to the Secretary of War, requesting a concise statement, under appropriate heads, of the whole expenditures of the United States to support their present relations and intercourse with the Indian tribes, and to ascertain, with as much accuracy as possible, the annual expense of the education of Indian youths by the missionary system. The documents received in reply to these inquiries the committee present to the House, and make them a part of this report; they exhibit the expenditures of the last two years, and an estimate for the year 1826; that for 1824 amounted to $424,978 60; for the year 1825, $671,470 59. Of the above sums, $12,708 48 appears to be expended for civilization and education in 1824, and $13,620 41 in 1825. The committee are not advised of any law authorizing the expenditure of a greater amount annually than $10,000 for the objects of civilization and education. A statement, showing the number of Indian schools, where established, and the amount paid to each for the year 1825, has been laid before the House at its present session, (to which the committee refer, and make a part of their report;) by which it appears a greater sum than the annual appropriation has been expended the last year, and also a greater amount for the year 1824, as above stated. The estimate showing the probable amount of disbursements in the Indian Department in the year 1826 amounts to $1,082,474 68, as will be seen by statement C. The committee, anxious to afford the House every information in their power in regard to the costs of Indian relations, applied to the Clerk of the House of Representatives, and received statement D, which shows that bills have been reported at the present session of Congress to appropriate the sum of $1,247,716 17; a part of them, however, it is believed, will not pass into laws at this time. The committee are informed by the Indian Department that $1,280 is given to the Cherokee nation annually, under a supposition that the United States ought to distribute the annuities, and which sum is paid as an equivalent to the nation for performing that duty. The committee can find no treaty or act of Congress to justify such disbursement, and have no hesitation in saying it ought to be abandoned. . In the prosecution of their inquiries, the committee have turned their attention not only to the trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, but to their civilization and education. It appears by statement B, accompanying this report, that the amount received from Government and all other resources by the missionaries in the year 1824, is $191,606; in 1825, $202,070 85; and it is presumed the amount will be somewhat increased in the present year. The committee have not such information as would enable them to say with certainty what progress is making in the accomplishment of this desirable object, but have reason to believe that much good has been dene. All which is respectfully submitted. SIR;	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, April 22, 1826. I have the honor to enclose, herewith, papers marked O, and A, B, C, which contain the information called for by your letter of the 14th instant, except as to the cost in detail of the expenses of Indians visiting the seat of Government for the period which forms the basis of the other items. This the Auditor is directed to prepare, and, so soon as it is ready, it will be furnished. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, JAMES BARBOUR. To the Hon. JOHN COCKE, Chairman of Committee on Indian Affairs, House of Reps. O. SIR:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, OFFICE INDIAN AFFAIRS, April 21, 1826. I have the honor to accompany this with three statements, prepared by your directions, marked A, B, C, which contain the information called for by the honorable the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs of the House of Representatives of the 14th instant. The whole amount paid on account of the relations and intercourse between ihe United States and the Indian tribes was, for 1824, $424,978 60; and for 1825, $671,470 59. This will appear on reference to statement A, which distinguishes also the sevetal heads of appropriation, on account of which these sums were expended. Statement B exhibits the amount employed in the system of Indian civilization, and distinguishes between the amount paid by the Government and that collected by the missionaries from individuals and societies formed for the promotion of this object. The amount paid in 1824 by the Government was $12,708 48, and in 1825, $13,620 41; and that which has been furnished from private contributions for the first of these years, as it would appear from the statement, amounted to $170,147 52, and in the last to $176,700 44. It may be proper to remark, however, that the first sum (for 1824) was the accumulated amount of at least seven years, (that is, from 1817, when the system went into operation, to 1824;) and which was expended in buildings, and in stock, and labor in clearing the grounds, &c.; and that the difference between these two sums, which is $6,552 92, is that which was collected between the termination of the first and the last of these years. Statement C exhibits the probable amount which may be expended in the present year, which is $1,082,474 68J; which does not include the amount that may be appropriated for settling the Indians on lands west of the Mississippi, should the bill for that object pass; nor for the difference paid to citizens of Georgia, under the fourth article of the treaty of the 8th January, 1821, and the sum originally appropriated, and for which provision is proposed by a bill reported the 18th ultimo by the Committee on Indian Affairs of the House of Representatives. Should both those bills pass, it is presumed but a small portion of the sums which may be appropriated to carry them into effect would be expended in the present year. In reply to the inquiry of the committee in regard to rations issued to Indians, it may be proper to state, that the amount paid for this object constitutes one of the charges upon the contingent fund. The particular amount would be furnished, but the agents’ accounts are not in this office, but with the proper accounting officers of the Treasury; to the annual returns from whom to Congress reference is respectfully made for this information, as also for a detail of every charge to which that fund is liable. In 1819 an arrangement was made with the Cherokees, on the recommendation of their then agent, Colonel Meigs, by which it was agreed to make them an annual and specific payment of $1,280 in lieu of rations. The accounts of expenses attending the visits of Indians to the seat of Government are with the Auditor. The cest per day for each Indian is front one dollar and twenty-five cents to one dollar and fifty cents for board. This, together with clothing, which is sometimes given to them, is paid for, generally, from the contingencies of the Department. But the cost of the visit of the Choctaws in 1825 was paid out of a specific appropriation of $10,000, of which $9,723 44 was expended, as is shown in abstract A. With these Indians an important treaty was concluded. Respectfully submitted. To the Hen. JAMES BARBOUR, Secretary of War. A.
