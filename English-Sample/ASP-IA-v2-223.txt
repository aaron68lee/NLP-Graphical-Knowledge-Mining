NO. 223 EXPENDITURES OF THE INDIAN DEPARTMENT, AND THE STATE OF OUR RELA- TIONS WITH THE SEVERAL TRIBES. COMMUNICATED TO CONGRESS, ON THE 6TH OF DECEMBER, 1825. [S,R:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, OFFICE INDIAN AFFAIRS, November 30, 1825. I have had the honor to receive your directions of the'3d ultimo, as follows: “You will, as early a? practicable, report to me an estimate of the amount which will be required to be appropriated for the current expenses of the Indian Department for the year 1826. “ You will also report, separately, the amount of money disbursed and settled in the Indian Department, from the commencement of the present year to the termination of the third quarter of it, including disbursements for the same period under the appropriation for the civilization of the Indian tribes; the number of schools, where established, by what society, the number of teachers at each, and the number of pupils, by last reports; together with the effects, as already developed, of the present system for civilizing the Indians, and its probable and ulterior consequences upon them as a race, viewed both in relation to their present situation, and that which contemplates their future and permanent residence upon lands west of the Mississippi. You will report, also, the operations of commissioners appointed to hold Indian treaties under acts of the last session of Congress, and such other remarks as you may think proper to make in relation to the administration of the Indian Department.” I had the honor, on the 14th ultimo, to furnish the estimate of the amount ($153,000) required to be appropriated for the Current expenses of the year 1826. The accompanying statement, which I have the honor now to submit, (marked A,) shows the amount of money that has been drawn from the treasury, on account of the Indian Department, for the first, second, and third quarters of the present year; how much of that amount has been settled; and how much remains to be accounted for. It appears from this statement that $781,827 14 has been drawn from the treasury; that $535,017 87 has been accounted for; and that there remains to be accounted for $246,809 27. It is proper to remark, that the sum of $191,368 91, which appears from the statement to be accounted for, is the unapplied balance of the appropriation of the 3d March, 1825, of $250,000, in reference to a treaty with the Creeks; and is, though drawn from the treasury, subject, at the pleasure of the Department, to its orders. If this sum be deducted from the balance of $246,809 27, there will remain to be accounted for $55,440 36; all which, it is believed, will be fully accounted for when several returns, which are daily expected, shall be received. Statement marked B shows the number of schools, where established, by. what society, the number of teachers at each, and the number of pupils, according to the last reports. These returns show that thirty-eight schools are in operation, and that they contain eleven hundred and fifty-nine children. On comparing this with the report of last year, it will be found that four new schools have been established, and that the increase in the number of children, for this year, is two hundred and forty-three. Measures were duly taken to carry into effect the acts of Congress of the 25th May, 1824, (I go back to this, because its provisions have but just been executed,) and of the 3d March, 1825: the former having for its object the formation of treaties beyond the Mississippi; the latter, the establishment of peace and boundaries between the various tribes of the Upper Mississippi and the lakes; also, another act of the 3d March, 1825, authorizing the President to cause a road to be marked out from the western frontier of Missouri to the confines of New Mexico, and which act also makes provision for holding treaties with the intervening Indian tribes, for the purpose of obtaining their consent to the marking of said road, and to the unmolested use thereof to the citizens of the United States and of the Mexican republic. Advices have been received of as late date as the 21st September last, from General Atkinson and Major O’Fallon, the commissioners appointed to carry into effect the provisions of the act of the 25th May, 1824; at which period they were at Fort Atkinson, on the Missouri, to which place they had returned two days previous to the date of their letter, after having penetrated the country as far as the Two Thousand Mile creek, and fully accomplished, so far, the objects of their commission. It only remained for them to treat with a few tribes, the Ma- has, Ottoes, Missourias, and Pawnees, which they expected to accomplish in twelve days, when they were to descend to St. Louis, and report more in detail. It is understood that General Atkinson is on his way to this city, bringing with him the treaties; and that the entire object of the commission is accomplished. Returns have been received from General Clark and Governor Cass, the commissioners appointed to mediate, at Prairie du Chien, between the Sioux, Sac, Fox, loway, Chippewa, Menomonie, and Winnebago tribes, and to establish boundaries between them. In this work of mercy the commissioners have been successful. Treaties have been entered into with those tribes, by which their long and bloody wars have been terminated, and boundaries assigned to them, as the surest guaranty against future hostilities. Messrs. Reeves, Sibley, and Mather, the commissioners appointed to mark the road from the western frontier of Missouri to the confines of New Mexico, and to hold treaties with the intervening Indian tribes, are engaged in the performance of those duties. With the view of adjusting certain claims of the Shawanee Indians for lands, in exchange for a tract hitherto occupied by them at Cape Girardeau, in Missouri, and for spoliations of various kinds, and improvements left by them at Cape Girardeau, General Clark was directed, in March last, to adjust these claims, and authorized, should it be necessary, to treat with the Osage and Kanzas tribes for the extinguishment of their titles to lands for those Jndiaus. This arrangement has been accordingly made; and, in accomplishing it, and following up the views of the Executive, in providing a country for such tribes of Indians as may think proper to emigrate and join their friends in the west, but especially to secure a country for the Creeks, in pursuance of the obligations of the General Government in its compact with Georgia, the commissioner very judiciously embraced, in the negotiation for the accommodation of the Shawanees, at that meeting, an extinguishment of the Indian titles to three or four millions of acres of land in Missouri and Arkansas, and nearly one hundred millions of acres beyond the western boundaries of Missouri and Arkansas. Reservations are secured to the Osages and Kanzas: to the first, a tract of fifty miles front, parallel to, and about twenty-five miles west of, the western boundary of Missouri; and to the Kanzas, a tract of thirty miles front, parallel also to the western boundary of Missouri, and about fifty miles west of it; both running back to the Spanish line. A judicious arrangement as to space between those two reservations, and between the frontier of Missouri, has been effected. Thus, all the titles of Indians to lands within the limits of Missouri, except a few reservations, have been extinguished; and a country represented to be fertile, and in all respects desirable, provided, and in sufficient extent, beyond the boundaries of Missouri and Arkansas, for the accommodation of all the tribes within the States, which, should they incline to occupy it, it is the policy of the Government to guaranty to them lasting and undisturbed possession.	. At the same time, treaties of peace and friendship were entered into between the Osage and Delaware, the Shawanee, Wea, Piankeslraw, and Peoria tribes of Indians; and, subsequently, a treaty has been concluded, which assigns to the Shawanees fifty miles square of lands in the southwest corner of Missouri, with the privilege of exchanging them for a like quantity of land on"the Kanzas river, (which, it is believed, they will prefer,) for' lands of theirs hitherto occupied hy them at Cape Girardeau. The same treaty provides for payment for improvements abandoned by them at Cape Girardeau, and for spoliations committed on their property there. From the representations of a deputation of Cherokees of the Arkansas and the Shawanees, who accompanied them in February last, it was believed that’if they could hold a council with their friends in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, they could induce them to emigrate and join them on their possessions in the west. This was the great object of their visit. Directions were issued to Governor Cass to meet them at Wapaghkonetta, in Ohio; but nothing was accomplished, except that deputations of some of the tribes intend, in the following spring, to visit their bro- 74 E thers of the west. It is probable that the object of that meeting may, in the course of the next year, be in part, at least, realized.	. The Quapaws, it is expected, will commence their removal from Arkansas to the country south uf Red river on the 1st of January next, in conformity to the provisions of the treaty with them of the 15th November, 1824; and measures have been taken to fulfil the provisions of that entered into with the Choctaws on the 20th January, 1825. Nothing suggests itself to me in the way of improvement in the administration of the Indian Department, as it is at present constituted; but under the modification which I had the honor to suggest to you in my letter of the 15th instant, benefits of a valuable description might be anticipated. . I will do myself the honor, in obedience to your instructions, to make the remaining parts of your directions of 3d October the subject of a future and special communication.	®	. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, THOMAS L. MCKENNEY. Hon. JAMES BARBOUR, Secretary of War. A.
