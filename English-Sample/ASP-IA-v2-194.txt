NOTE.—The payments to expresses and for the transportation of annuities are not included in this abstract. The amount allowed for services in these cases cannot be separated from the expenses; and the insertion of the whole sum would exhibit an erroneous result in a return purporting to be for services only. The same remark will apply to a few charges in which the materials as well as the mechanical labor made part of the charge; but a statement of all these disbursements will be found in the quarterly abstracts of expenditures, transmitted herewith.
