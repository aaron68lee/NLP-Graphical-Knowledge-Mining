NO. 217 ABOLITION OF INDIAN TRADING-HOUSES. COMMUNICATED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE 21ST OF JANUARY", 1825. [To the House of Representatives:	WASHINGTON, January 20, 1825. In compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 19th December, 1822, requesting the President to communicate “what progress has been made in the execution of the act of last session entitled ‘An act to abolish the Indian trading establishment,’ with a report from the factories, respectively, as the same may be made to him,” I herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of the Treasury, with documents which contain the information requested. JAMES MONROE. SIR:	TREASURY DEPARTMENT, January 10,. 1825. I have the honor to submit, herewith, a report from the late agent for settling the concerns of the United States trading establishment with the Indians; which report, with those heretofore transmitted, contains the information requested by a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 19th December, 1822, referred by you to this Department. I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant, WM. H. CRAWFORD. gIR. .	INDIAN OFFICE, WASHINGTON, October 25, 1824. I have the honor to submit the following statements, which, with those submitted on the 1st December last, embrace all the information called for by a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 19th December, 1822, in the following words: “ Resolved, That the President be requested to communicate to this House what progress has been made in the execution of the act of last session, entitled ‘An act to abolish the Indian trading establishment,’ with a report from the factories, respectively, as the same may be made to him.” The general statement, with the abstracts referred to therein, marked from A to N, inclusive, exhibit the amount and description of the property received by the agents appointed to wind up the concerns of the United States Indian trading establishment, from the superintendent of Indian trade and the factors, respectively. The papers numbered from No. 1 to No. 11 exhibit the amount of property received by the several agents, and their respective returns as to the disposition of it. From these statements, it will be seen that the merchandise, of every description, which was turned over to the agents by the superintendent and factors, has been sold; that the agents have accounted for the property thus turned over, and adjusted their accounts; and that the nett proceeds, so far as they have come into the hands of the principal agent, have been paid into the treasury. The consolidated statement, numbered 12, exhibits the total amount of property received by the new,agents from the'superintendent and factors; the tôtal amount of salaries, commissions, and other expenses incurred in winding up the concern; the amount of debts not collected; the amount of buildings unsold; the amount of loss on the sales of merchandise, &.C.; and the ascertained loss in winding up the concern to the 1st of October, 1824. The factory buildings on the Arkansas and Red rivers, and that at Chicago, have been sold. The others have been put into the possession of officers commanding posts near where they are situated, to be disposed of, under instructions from the Department of War. The Indian agents residing at or near the late factories have been furnished with lists of the Indian and other debts due to them, respectively; and have been instructed, from the Department of War, to use their best endeavors to collect them. Many of the notes taken for sales of property, made by the new agents, are lying over under protests. They have all been placed in the hands of the United States district attorneys for collection, who have found it necessary to put some of them in suit. There is good reason, however, to believe that there will, eventually, be little or no loss in the collection of these notes, which are designated in the consolidated statement as “bills receivable.” 1 have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, GEORGE GRAHAM, Late Agent.

SIR:	INDIAN OFFICE, GEORGETOWN, January 22, 1823. I enclose a copy of a letter addressed by me to William Clark, Esq., superintendent of Indian affairs at St. Louis, with his answer, and have to request your instructions as to the propriety of sending the goods on hand at this office to St. Louis, or as to such other disposition of them as you may deem most expedient. The absence of all demand for goods adapted to the Indian trade in this District, together with the embarrassed state of its commerce, and the consequent scarcity of money, make it certain that the goods cannot be sold here, either at private or public sale, except at an immense sacrifice. I would therefore suggest the propriety of sending them to St. Louis, to be disposed of in conformity to the suggestions stated in the enclosed communications; or of shipping them to New York, under the charge of an agent, with instructions to sell them at vendue. The reasons for or against either of these modes of disposing of the goods will so readily suggest themselves to you, that it is unnecessary for me to recapitulate them. With great respect, your obedient servant, GEORGE GRAHAM, Agent. The Hon. WILLIAM H. CRAWFORD, Secretary of the Treasury. SIR:	INDIAN OFFICE, GEORGETOWN, November 7, 1822. I enclose you an invoice of the goods on hand at this office. Since the abolition of the Indian trading establishment, there is no demand at this place for Indian goods, and they cannot be sold here. I have proposed to the Secretary of the Treasury that they should be forwarded to you, to be used for Indian purposes for the years 1823 and 1824, and to be sold to individuals engaged in the Indian trade, allowing you a per centage on the amount disposed of by you, in either way. The goods are generally of good quality, particularly the woollens, which are excellent. As goods of this description are now lower than when these were imported, a deduction of twenty per cent, would be made on the invoice prices.	- I must request the favor of you to inform me whether you think it probable that the goods could be disposed of in St. Louis, for Indian purposes, or otherwise; and whether you would undertake to dispose of the whole, or any part of them. '	With great respect, your obedient servant, Gen. WM. CLARK, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, St. Louis. SIR:	ST. LOUIS, December 18,1822. Bv the last mail I received your letter of the 7th of November, accompanied by an invoice of Indian goods in the public store at Geoigetown, which you have proposed to the Secretary of the Treasury should be forwarded to me, to be used for Indian presents for the years 1823 and 1824, and to be sold to individuals in the Indian trade, &c. You express a wish to be informed whether it is probable that those goods can be disposed of in St. Louis for Indian presents or otherwise; and whether I would undertake to dispose of the whole, or any part of them, allowing me a per centage on the amount disposed of. As the goods are believed to be generally of good quality, I have no doubt but a part of them would answer very well for Indian presents. I think it probable that a part may be sold to Indian traders, on a credit; but I much doubt if those goods can be sold for cash, at the prices you propose, as, by deducting twenty per cent, from the first cost, the price of the goods will not be less than the same articles are sold by Messrs. Berthold, Chouteau, & Pratte; Messrs. Stone, Bostwick, & Co.; and Messrs. Crooks & Co., merchants engaged in the Indian trade at this place, who import their goods, of an excellent quality, and credit the traders whom they furnish until they make their trade with the Indians, which is usually one year. In making sales of Indian goods to individual traders, it is important to have all such articles as may be necessary to make (what they call) an equipment, &c. I observe by the invoice that all these articles are not embraced in it; there is a very great difference in the proportion of the several articles. The proportion of guns and blankets is too small, and red strouding, glass, &c. too large for other articles. However, many of the articles may be disposed of at private sale; and such as cannot be disposed of in that way, I can advise no better plan than their being sold at auction, or reserved as presents, to be delivered at some treaty, or to quiet Indian claims; in effecting which, they may be usefully disposed of, and on better terms than being sold at auction; and I think it not improbable that there will be some demand in the ensuing year, r If it is thought advisable to order these goods, or any others, to me, they shall be attended to, and 1 will dispose of them in any way you may advise. It may not be amiss to observe, that there are, in the warehouse belonging to the Indian Department at this place, a quantity of factory goods, which, I have reason to believe, are of such inferior quality that they will not sell for much, and in no other way than at vendoe, even at this place, which is considered, from its situation, to be the best calculated to sell Indian goods of any town on the continent; yet it has not been possible for the agent to dispose of them at private sale. Should you determine to send the goods mentioned in the invoice, or any part of them, to this place, to be disposed of, it will be important that they arrive here very early in the spring. I remain, with sentiments of respect, your most obedient servant, WILLIAM CLARK. Mr. GEORGE GRAHAM. SIR:	TREASURY DEPARTMENT, March 5, 1823. I am directed by the President to request that the Indian goods now in your possession be sent to New York, to the address of Hone & Towns, of the firm of which Mr. Hone is a partner, with directions that, after reasonable notice, they be disposed of at auction, for notes payable to you, as principal agent, at sixty and ninety days, negotiable in the office of discount and deposite in New York. I have also to request that the notes may be deposited in that office for collection. I remain, with respect, your most obedient servant,	WM. H. CRAWFORD. GEORGE GRAHAM, Esq. Principal Agent. GENTLEMEN:	INDIAN OFFICE, GEORGETOWN, March 11, 1823. By direction of the honorable the Secretary of the Treasury, I herewith enclose you invoice and bill of ladingof ninety-seven packages of merchandise,the property of the United States, shipped on board the sloop Abeona, William H. Nicholls, master, to your address, amounting to $31,175 2'8. These goods you will please sell at auction, on a credit of sixty and ninety days, for notes with unexceptionable endorsers, negotiable and payable at the office of discount and deposite, New York, first giving two or three weeks notice of the sale in the papers of your city. The uotes you will deposite in that office for collection, and forward to me the cashier’s receipt for them. As I have no samples of the goods to send you, it will be necessary to have the packages opened previous to the sale. I do not wish it to be known that the goods are the property of the United States, as purchasers are more apt to form combinations at the United States’ sales than at those of individuals. I wish the tierces to be kept olit of sight, as they would be immediately recognised as United States’ property by persons engaged in the Indian trade. A large portion of the goods being strouds and blankets of the heaviest kinds, and well suited for the Indian trade, it is hoped they will command good prices. You will please forward your accounts as soon after closing the sales as practicable. Very respectfully, I am, gentlemen, your obedient servant, GEORGE GRAHAM, Agent. Messrs. HONE & TOWNS, New York.	Per JERE. W. BRONAUGH. SIR:	NEW YORK, March 17, 1823. We have received this morning your favor of the 11th instant, with invoice and bill of lading of ninetyseven packages, shipped on board the Abeona, to oor address. The vessel has not yet arrived, but, as soon as she gets here, you may rely upon our paying every attention to your instructions with regard to the goods.

GENTLEMEN: \our favor of the I7th March last I duly received; in which you acknowledge the receipt of my letter of the 11th of March, covering invoice and bill of lading of sundry packages of goods forwarded to you, per the sloop Abeona, for sale at auction.

Although I was prepared to expect considerable loss on the sale of the goods, yet I must confess that the loss which has been incurred has very far exceeded any calculations which I had made upon the subject. The money and notes, the proceeds of the sales, should have been deposited in bank to my credit, as agent. 1 have written to the cashier, and forwarded the orders of the Treasurer on the subject, and will thank you to call at the bank and have the proper entries made.
