No. 8. [2d Session. THE CREEKS. COMMUNICATED TO THE SENATE JANUARY 11. 1790. Gentlemen of the Senate: Having advised with you upon the terms of a treaty to be offered to the Creek nation of Indians, I think it proper you should be informed ol the result of that business, previous to its coming before you in your legislative capacity. 1 have therefore directed the Secretary for the Department of War to lay before you my instructions* to the commissioners, and their report in consequence thereof. The apparently critical state of the southern frontier will render it expedient for me to communicate to both Houses of Congress, with other papers, the whole of the transactions relative to the Creeks, in order that they may be enabled to form a judgment of the measures which the case may require. GEO. WASHINGTON. United States, January Will, 1790. 1st Congress.]
