No. 131. [1st Session. NORTHWESTERN TRIBES. COMMUNICATED TO CONGRESS, DECEMBER 19, 1811. To the Semite and House of Representatives of the United States: I lay before Congress two letters received from Governor Harrison, of the Indiana territory, reporting the particulars and the issue of the expedition under his command, of which notice was taken in my communication of November 5th. While it is deeply lamented that so many valuable lives have been lost in the action which took place on the 7th ult. Congress will see, with satisfaction, the dauntless spirit and fortitude victoriously displayed by every description of the troops engaged, as well as the collected tirmness which distinguished their commander, on an occasion requiring the utmost exertions of valor and discipline. It may reasonably be expected that the good effects of this critical defeat and dispersion of a combination of savages, which appears to have been spreading to a greater extent, will be experienced not only in a cessation of the murders and depredations committed on our frontier, but in the prevention of any hostile incursions Otherwise to have been apprehended. The families of those brave and patriotic citizens who have fallen in tin’s severe conflict, will doubtless engage the favorable attention of Congress. JAMES MADISON. Washington, December 18M, 1611. , Vincennes, 16th November, 1811. Sir: In my letter of the 8th instant, I did myself the honor to communicate the result of an action between the troops under my command and the confederation of Indians under the control of the Shawanese prophet. Iliad previously informed you, in a letter of the 2d instant, of my proceedings previously to my arrival at the Vermillion river, where I had erected a block house for the protection of the boats which I was obliged to leave, and as a depository for our heavy baggage, and such part of our provisions as we were unable to transport in wagons. On the morning of the 3d instant, I commenced my march from the block house. The Wabash, above this, turning considerably to the eastward, I was obliged, in order to avoid the broken and woody country, which borders upon it, to change my course to the westward of north to gain the prairies which lie to the back of those woods. At the end of one day’s march, I was enabled to take the proper direction, (N. E.) which brought me, on the evening of the 5th, to a small creek, at about eleven miles from the Prophet’s town. I had, on the preceding day, avoided the dangerous pass of Pine creek, by inclining a few miles to the left, where the troops and wagons were crossed with expedition and safety. Our route on the 6th, for about six miles, lay through prairies, separated by small points of woods. My order of march hitherto had been similar to that used by General Wayne; that is, the infantry were in two columns of files on either side of the road, and the mounted riflemen and cavalry in front, in the rear, and on the flanks. Where the ground was unfavorable for the action of cavalry, they were placed on the rear, but where it was otherwise, they were made to exchange positions with one of the mounted rifle corps. Understanding that the last four miles were open woods, and the probability being greater that we should be attacked in front than on either flank, I halted at that distance from the town, and formed the army in order of battle. The U. S. infantry placed in the centre, two companies of militia infantry, and one of mounted riflemen, on each flank, formed the front line. In the rear of this line was placed the baggage, drawn up as compactly as possible, and immediately behind it a reserve of three companies of militia infantry. The cavalry formed a second line, at the distance of three hundred yards in the rear of the front line, and a company of mounted riflemen the advanced guard at that distance in front. To facilitate the march, the whole were then broken oft'in short columns of companies—a situation the most favorable for forming in order of battle with facility and precision. Our march was slow and cautious, and much delayed by the examination of every place which seemed calculated for an ambuscade. Indeed, the ground was, for some time, so unfavorable, that I was obliged to change the position of the several corps three times in the distance of a mile. At half past two o’clock, we passed, a small creek at the distance of one mile and a half from the town, and entered an open wood, when the army was halted; and again drawn up in order of battle. During the whole of the last day’s march, parties of Indians were constantly about us, and every effort was made by the interpreters to speak to them, but in vain. New attempts of the kind were now made, but, proving equally ineffectual, a Capt. Dubois, of the spies and guides, offering to go with a flag to the town, I despatched him, with an interpreter, to request a conference with the Prophet. In a few moments a messenger was sent by Captain Dubois to inform me that, in his attempts to advance, the Indians appeared on both his flanks, and although he had spoken to them in the most friendly manner, they refused to answer, but beckoned to him to go forward, and constantly endeavored to cut him oft’ from the army. Upon this information, I recalled the Captain, and determined to encamp for the night, and take some other measures for opening a conference with the Prophet. Whilst I was engaged in tracing the lines for the encampment. Major Daviess, who commanded the dragoons, came to inform me that he had penetrated to the Indian fields; that the ground was entirely open and favorable; that the Indians in front had manifested nothing but hostility, and had answered every attempt to bring them to a parley, with contempt and insolence. 1 was immediately advised by all the officers around me to move forward; a similar wish indeed pervaded all the army. It was drawn up in excellent order, and every man appeared eager to decide the contest immediately. Being informed that a good encampment might be had upon the Wabash, I yielded to what appeared the general wish, and directed the troops to advance, taking care, however, to place the interpreters in front, with directions to invite a conference with any Indians they might meet with. We had not advanced above four hundred yards when I was informed that three Indians had approached the advanced guard, and had expressed a wish to speak to me. 1 found, upon their arrival, that one of them was a man in great estimation with the Prophet. He informed me that the chiefs were much surprised at my advancing upon them so rapidly; that they were given to understand, by the Delawares and Miamies, whom I had sent to them a few days before, that I would not advance to their town until I had received an answer to my demands made through them; that this answer had been despatched by the Pattawa-tamy chief, Winnemae, who had accompanied the Miamies and Delawares on their return; that they had left the Prophet’s town two days before, with a design to meet me. but had unfortunately taken the road on the south side of the Wabash. I answered that! had no intention of attacking them, until I discovered that they would not comply witj) the demands that I Imd made; that I would go on and encamp at the Wabash; and in the morning would have an interview with the Prophet and his chiefs, and explain to them the determination of the President; that, in the mean time, no hostilities should be committed. He seemed much pleased with this, and promised that it should be observed on their parts. I then resumed my march. We struck the cultivated ground about five hundred yards below the town, but as these extended to the bank of the \\ abash, there was no possibility of getting an encampment which was provided with both wood and water. guides and interpreters being still with the advanced guard, and taking the direction of the town, the army followed, an.d had advanced within about one hundred and fifty yards, when fifty or sixty Indians sallied out, and. with loud acclamations' called to the cavalry and to the militia infantry, which were on our light flunk, to halt. I immediately advanced to the front, caused the army to halt, and directed an interpreter to request some of the chiefs to come to me. In a few moments the man who had been with me before, made his appearance. I informed him that my object, for the present, was to procure a good piece of ground to encamp on, where we cotdd get wood and water. He informed me that there was a creek to the northwest which he thought would suit our purpose. I immediately despatched two officers to examine it, and they reported that the situation was excellent. I then took leave of the chief, and a mutual promise, was again made for suspension of hostilities until we could have an interview on the following day. I found the ground destined for the encampment not altogether such as I could wish it. It was, indeed, admirably calculated for the encampment of regular troops that were opposed to regulars, but it afforded great facility to the approach of savages. It was a piece of dry oak land, rising about ten feet above the level of a marshy prairie in front, (towards the Indian town) and nearly twice that height above a similar prairie in the rear, through which, and near to this bank, ran a small stream clothed with willows and brush wood. Towards the left flank this bench of high land widened considerably, but became gradually tBrrower in the opposite direction, and at the distance of one hundred and fifty yards from the right flank terminated in an abrupt point. The two columns of infantry occupied the front and rear of this ground, at the distance of about one hundred and fifty yards from each other on the left, and something more than half that distance on the right flank. These flanks were filled up. the first by two companies Efi mounted riflemen, amounting to about one hundred and twenty men, under the command of Major General Wells, of the Kentucky militia, who served as a major, the other by Spencer's company of mounted riflemen, which amounted to eighty men. The front line was composed of one battalion of United States' infantry, under the command of Major Floyd, flanked on the right by two companies of militia, and on the left by one company. The rear line was composed of a battalion of United States' troops, under the command of Captain Haen, acting as major, and four companies of militia infantry, under Lieutenant Colonel Decker. The regular troops of this line joined the mounted riflemen under General Wells on the left flank, and Colonel Decker's battalion formed an angle with Spencer's company on the left. Two troops of dragoons, amounting to, in the aggregate, about sixty men. were encamped in the rear cf the left flank, and Captain Parke's troop, which was larger Than the other two, in the rear of the front line. Our order of encampment varied little from that above described, excepting when some peculiarity of the ground made it necessary. For a night attack, the order of e ncampment was the oruer of battle, and each man slept immediately opposite to his post in the line. In the formation of my troops I used a single rank, or what is called Indian file; because, in Indian warfare, where there is no shock to resist, one rank is nearly as goad as two, and in that kind of warfare, the extension of line is a matter of the first importance. Raw troops also manoeuvre with much more facility in single than in double ranks. It was my constant custom to assemble all the field officers at my tent, every evening, by signal, to give them the watch-word, and their instructions for the night; those given for the night of the 6th were, that each corps which formed a part of the exterior line of the encampment should hold its own ground until relieved. The dragoons were directed to parade dismounted, in case of a night attack, with their pistols in their belts, and to act as a corps de reserve. The cam]) was defended by two captain's guards, consisting each of lour non commissioned officer.-, and forty-two privates, and two subaltern's guards of twenty non-commissioned officers and privates. The whole under the command of a field officer of the day. The troops were regularly called up, an hour before day. and made to continue underarms until it was quite light. On the morning of the 7th. I had risen a quarter after I o'clock, and the signal for calling out the men would have been given in two minutes, when the attack commenced. It began on our left flank; but a single gun was fired by the sentinels or by the guard in that direction, which made not the least resistance, but abandoned their officer and fled into camp, and the first notice which the troops of that flank had of the danger, was from the yells of the savages within a short distance of the line; but. even under those circumstances, the men were not wanting to themselves or to the occasion. Such of them us were awake, or were easily awakened, seized their arms, and took their stations, others, which were more tardy, had to contend with the enemy in the doors of their tents. The storm first fell tipun Captain Barton's company, of the 4th United States' regiment, and Captain Geiger's company of mounted riflemen, which formed the lei’t angle of the rear line. The fire upon these was excessively severe, and they suffered considerably before relief could be brought to them. Some few Indians passed into the encampment near the angle, and one or two penetrated to some distance, before they were killed. I believe all the other companies were under arms and tolerably formed before they were fired on. The morning was dark and cloudy. Our tires afforded a partial light, which, if it gave us some opportunity of taking our positions, was still more advantageous to the enemy, affording them the means of taking a surer aim; they were, therefore, extinguished as soon as possible. Under all these discouraging circumstances, the troops (nineteen-twentieths of whom had never been inaction before) behaved in a inauner that can never be too much applauded. They took their places without noise, and with less confusion than could have been expected from veterans, placed in a similar situation. As soon as I could mount my horse, I rode to the angle that was attacked. I found that Barton's company had suffered severely, and the left of Geiger's entirely broken. I immediately ordered Cook's company, and the late Captain Wentworth's, under Lieutenant Peters, to be brought up from the centre of the rear line, where the ground was much more defensible, and formed across the angle in support of Barton’s and Geigers. My attention was then engaged by a heavy firing upon the left of the front line, where were, stationed the small company of United States' riflemen, (then, however, armed with muskets) and the companies of Baen, Snelling, and Prescott, of die 4th regiment. I found Major Daviess forming the dragoons in the rear of those companies; and understanding that the heaviest part of the enemy's major was mortally wounded, and his party driven back. The Indians were, however, immediately and gallantly dislodged from their advantageous position by Captain Sneliing, at the head of his company. In the course of a few minutes after the commencement of the attack, the Are extended along the left flank, the whole of the front, the right flank, and part of the rear line. Upon Spencer's mounted riflemen, and the right of Warwick's company, wnich was posted on the right of the rear line, it was excessively severe. Captain Spencer, and his first and second lieutenants, were killed, and Captain Warwick mortally wounded. Those companies, however, still bravely maintained their posts, but Spencer had suffered so severely, and having originally too much ground to occupy, I reinforced them with Robb’s company of riflemen, which had been drawn, or, by mi-take, ordered from their p.aitioit on the left flank, towards the centre of the camp; and filled the vacancy that had been occupied by Robb, with Prescott's company of the 4th United States] regiment. My great object was to keep the lines entire, to prevent the enemy from breaking into the camp, until day-light should enable me to make a general and effectual charge. With this view, 1 had reinforced every part of the line that had suffered much, and as scon as the approach of morning had discovered itself, I withdrew from the front line Sneliing',-, Posey's, (under Lieutenant Albright) and Scott's, and from the rear line, Wilson's, companies, and drew them up upon the left flank, and, at the same time, I ordered Cook's anil Baen’s companies, the former from the rear, and the latter from the front line, to reinforce the right flank, foreseeing that, at these points, the enemy would make their last efforts. Major Wells, who commanded on the left flank, not knowing my intentions precisely, had taken the command of these companies, and had charged the enemy before I had formed the body of dragoons, with which I meant to support the infantry; a small detachment of these were, however, ready, and proved amply sufficient for the purpose. The Indians were driven by the. infantry at the point of the bayonet, and the dragoons pursued and forced them into a marsh, where they could not be followed. Captain Cook and Lieutenant Larabee had, agreeably to my order, marched their companies to the right flank; had formed them under the tire of the enemy, and, being then joined by the riflemen of that flank, had charged the Indians, killed a number, and put the rest to a precipitate flight. A favorable opportunity was here offered to pursue the enemy with dragoons, but being engaged at that time on the other flank, I did not observe it until it was too late. I have thus, sir, given you the particulars of an action which was certainly maintained with the greatest obstinacy and perseverance by both parties. The Indians manifested a ferocity, uncommon even with them. To their savage fury, our troops opposed that cool and deliberate valor which is characteristic of the Christian soldier. The most pleasing part of my duty, (that of naming to you the corps and individuals who particularly distinguished themselves) is yet to be performed. There is, however, considerable difficulty in it: where merit was so common, it is almost impossible to discriminate. The whole of the infantry formed a small brigade, under the immediate orders of Colonel Boyd. The colonel, throughout the action, manifested equal zeal and bravery, in carrying into execution my orders, in keeping the men to their posts, and exhorting them to fight with valor. Ilis brigade major, Clarke, and his aid-de-camp, George Croghan, Esquire, were also very serviceably employed. Colonel Joseph Bartholemew, a very valuable officer, commanded, under Colonel Boyd, the militia infantry. He was wounded early in the action, and his services lost to me. Major G. R. C. Floyd, the senior officer of the fourth United States’ regiment, commanded immediately the battalion of that regiment, which was in the front line; his conduct, during the action, was entirely to my satisfaction. Lieutenant Colonel Decker, who commanded the battalion of militia on the right of the rear line, preserved his command in good ol der. He was, however, but partially attacked. I have before mentioned to you, that Major General Wells, of the fourth division of Kentucky militia, acted under my command as a major, at the head of two companies of mounted volunteers. The general maintained the fame which he had already acquired in almost every campaign and in almost every battle which has been fought with the Indians, since the settlement of Kentucky. Of the several corps, the fourth United States’ regiment and the two small companies attached to it, were certainly the most conspicuous for undaunted valor. The companies commanded by Captains Cook, Snelling, and Barton, Lieutenants Larabee, Peters, and Hawkins, were placed in situations where they could render most service and encounter most danger, and those officers eminently distinguished themselves. Captains Prescott and Brown performed their duty, also, entirely to my satisfaction, as did Posey’s company of the seventh regiment, headed by Lieutenant Albright. In short, sir, they supported the fame of American regulars, and I have never heard that a single individual was found out of the line of his duty. Several of the militia com panics were in no wise inferior to the regulars. Spencer’s, Geiger’s, and Warwick’s, maintained their posts amidst a monstrous carnage, as indeed did Robb’s, after it was posted on the. left flank; its loss of men, (seventeen killed and wounded) and keeping its ground, is sufficient evidence of its firmness. Wilson’s and Scott’s companies charged with the regular troops, and proved themselves worthy of doing so. Norris's company, also, behaved well. Hargrove’s and Wilkin's companies were placed in a situation where they had no opportunity of distinguishing themselves, or I am satisfied they would have done it. This .was the case with the squadron of dragoons, also: after Major Daviess had received his wound, knowing it to be mortal, I promoted Captain Parke to the majority, than whom, there is no better officer. My two aids-de-camp, Majors Hurd and Taylor, with Lieutenant Adams, of the fourth "regiment, the adjutant of the troops,afforded me the most essential aid, as well in the action, as throughout the campaign. The arrangements of Captain Piatt, in the quartermaster’s department, were highly judicious, and his exertions, on all occasions, particularly in bringing off the wounded, deserve my wannest thanks. But, in giving merited praise to the living, let me not forget the gallant dead. _ _ Colonel Abraham Owen, commandant of the 18th Kentucky regiment, joined me a few days before the action, as a private in Captain Geiger’s company; he accepted the appointment of volunteer aid-de-camp to me; he fell early in the action: the representatives of his State will inform you, that she possessed not a better citizen nor a braver man. Major J. II. Daviess was known as an able lawyer and a great orator; lie joined me as a private volunteer, and, on the recommendation of the officers of that corps, was appointed to command the three troops of dragoons; his conduct in that capacity, justified their choice; never was there an officer possessed of more ardor and zeal to discharge his duties with proprielv, and never one who would have encountered greater danger to purchase military fame. Captain Baen, of the fourth United States’ regiment, was killed early in the action: he was unquestionably a good officer and valiant soldier. Captains Spencer and Warwick, and Lieutenants McMahan and Berry, were all my particular friends. I have ever had the utmost confidence in their valor, and I was not deceived. Spencer was wounded in the head: he exhorted his men to fight valiantly; he was shot through both thighs, and fell, still continuing to encourage them: lie was raised up, and received a ball through his body, which put an immediate end to his existence. Warwick was shot immediately through the body; being taken to the surgery to be dressed, as soon as it was over, (being a man of great bodily vigor and still able to walk) he insisted upon going back to head his company, although it was evident that he had but a few hours to live. All these gentlemen, sir, Captain Baen excepted, have left wives, and five of them, large families of children. This is the case, too, with many of the privates among the militia, who fell in the action, or who have died since, of their wounds. Will the bounty of their country be withheld from their helpless orphans, many of whom will be in the most destitute condition, and, perhaps, want even the necessaries of life? With respect to the number of Indians that were engaged against us, I am possessed of no data by which I can form a correct statement. It must, however, have been considerable, and perhaps not much inferior to,our own, which, deducting the dragoons, who were unabie to do us much service, was very little above seven hundred noncommissioned officers and privates. I am convinced there were, at least, six hundred. The Prophet had, three weeks before, four hundred and fifty of his own proper followers. I am induced to believe, that he was joined by a number of the lawless vagabonds who live on the Illinois river, as large trails were seen coming from that direction. Indeed, I shall not be surprised to find, that some of those who professed the warmest friendship for us, were arrayed against us. It is certain, tlmt one of this description came out from the town, and spoke to me the night before the action. The Pattawatamy chief, whom I mentioned to have been wounded and taken prisoner in my letter of the 8th instant, 1 lefton the battle gound, after having taken all the care of him in my power. I requested him to inform those of his own tribe who had joined the Prophet, and the Kickapoos, and the Winnebagoes, that, if they would immediately abandon the Prophet, and return to their own tribes, their past conduct would be forgiven, and, that we would treat them as we formerly had done. He assured me that he would do so, and that there was no doubt of their compliance. Indeed, lie said that lie was certain that they would put the Prophet to death. I think, upon the whole, that there will be no further hostilities; but, of this, I shall be enabled to give you some more certain information in a few days. The troops left the battle ground on the 9th instant; it took every wagon to transport the wounded; we managed, however, to bring off the public property, although almost all the. private baggage of the officers was necessarily destroyed. It may, perhaps, be imagined, sir, that some means might have been adopted to have made a more early discovery of the approach of the enemy to our camp, the morning of the 7th instant. But, if I had employed two-thirds of the army as out posts, it would have been ineffectual; tne Indians, in such a night, would have found means to have passed between them. Placed in the situation that we were, there is no other mode of avoiding a surprise, than by a chain of sentinels, so close together that the enemy cannot pass between, without discovery, and, having the army in such readiness, that they can get to their alarm posts at a moment’s warning. Our troops could not have been better prepared than they were, unless they had been kept under arms the whole night, as they lay with their accoutrements on, and their arms by their sides, and the moment they were up, they were at their posts. ' If the sentinels and the guards had done their duty, even the troops on the left flank would have been prepared to receive the Indians. 1 have the honor to enclose you a correct return of our killed and wounded. The wounded suffered very much before their arrival here, but they are now comfortably fixed, and every attention has been, and shall continue to be, paid to them. Doctor Foster is not only possessed of great professional merit, but is, moreover, a man of feeling and honor. 1 am convinced, sir, that the Indians lost many more men than we did. They left from thirty-six to forty on the field. They were seen to take oft', not only the wounded, but the dead. An Indian that was killed and scalped in the beginning of the action, by one of our men, was found in a house in the town. Several others were also found in the liouses, and many graves, which were fresh dug; one of them was opened, and found to contain three dead bodies. Our infantry used, principally, cartridges containing twelve buck-shot, which were admirably calculated for a night action. I have before informed you, sir, that Colonel Miller was prevented, by illness, front going on the expedition; he rendered essential service in the command of fort Harrison; lie is an officer of great merit. There are so many circumstances, which it is important for you to know, respecting the situation of this country, that I have thought it best to commit this despatch to my aid-de-camp, Major Taylor, who will have the honor of delivering it to you, and will be able to give.you more satisfaction than I could do, oy writing. Major Taylor (who is also one of our supreme judges) is a man of integrity and honor, and you may rely upon any statements he may make. With the highest respect, 1 have the honor to be. sir, your humble servant, WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON. P. S. Not a man of ours was taken prisoner, and of three scalps which were taken, two of them were recovered. The Honorable W. Eustis, Secretary of War.

ADAMS, Adjutant to the Army* To his Excellency the Commander-in-chief. Vincennes, 4th December, 1811. Sir: I have the honor to inform you that two principal chiefs of the Kickapoos of the Prairie arrived here, bearing a flag, on the evening before last. They informed me, that they came in consequence of a message from the chief of that part of the Kickapoos which had joined the prophet, requiring them to do so, and that the said chief is to be here himself, in a day or two. The account which they give of the late confederacy under the prophet, is as follows: “ The prophet, with his Shawanese, is at a small Huron village, about twelve miles Irani his former residence, on this side of the Wabash, where, also, were twelve or fifteen Hurons. The Kickapoos are encamped near to the Tippecanoe. The Pattawatamies have scattered and gone to different villages of that tribe. The Winnebagoes had all set out on their return to their own country, excepting one chief and nine men, who remained at their lbrmer village. The latter had attended Tecuinseh in his tour to the southward, and had only returned to the Prophet’s town the day before the action. The Prophet had sent a messenger to the Kickapoos of the Prairie, to request that he might be permitted to retire to their town. This w as positively refused, and a warning sent to him, not to come there. He then sent to request that four of his men might attend the Kickapoo chief here—this was also refused. These chiefs say, on the whole, that all the tribes who lost warriors in the late action, attribute their misfortune to the Prophet, alone; that they constantly reproach him with their misfortunes, anil threaten him with death; that they are all desirous of making their peace with the United States, and will send deputations to me for that purpose, as soon as they are informed that they will be well received. The two chiefs further say, that they were sent by Governor Howard and General Clarke, sometime before the action, to endeavor to bring off the Kickapoos from the Prophet’s town: that they used their best endeavors to effect it, but unsuccessfully. That the Prophet’s followers were fully impressed with a belief that they could defeat us with ease; that it was their intention to have attacked us at fort Harrison, if we had gone, no higher; that Racoon creek was then fixed on, and finally, Pine creek; and that the latter would probably have been the place, if the usual route had not been abandoned, and a crossing made higher up; (hat the attack made on our sentinels, at fort Harrison, was intended to shut the door against accommodation; that the Win-nebagoes had forty warriors killed in the action, and the Kickapoos eleven, and ten wounded. They have never heard how many of the Pattawatainies, and other tribes, were killed. That the Pattawatamy chief left by me on the battle ground, is since dead of his wounds, but that he faithfully delivered my speech to the different tribes, and warmly urged them to abandon the Prophet and submit to my terms.” 1 cannot say, sir, how much of the above may be depended on. I believe, however, that the statement made by the chief is generally correct, particularly with regard to the present disposition of the Indians. It is certain that our frontiers have never enjoyed more profound tranquillity than at this time. No injury of any kind, that I can hear of. has been done, either to the persons or property of our citizens. Before the expedition, not a fortnight passed over, without some vexatious depredation being committed. The Kickapoo chiefs certainly tell an untruth, when they say, that there were but eleven of their tribe killed, and ten wounded; it is impossible to believe that fewer were wounded than killed. They acknowledge, however, that the Indians have never sustained so severe a defeat, since their acquaintance with the white people. I have the honor to be, &c. WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON. Hon. William Eustis, Esq. Secretary of War. P. S. The chief of the Vermillion Kickapoos lias this moment arrived. 12th Congress.]
