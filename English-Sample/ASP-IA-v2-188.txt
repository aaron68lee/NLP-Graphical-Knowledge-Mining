NO. 188.	[1st SESSION. NAMES AND PAY OF ALL THE PERSONS EMPLOYED LN THE INDIAN DEPARTMENT. COMMUNICATED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, APRIL 12, 1822. SIR:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, April 11, 1822? Pursuant to a resolution of the House of Representatives, directing the Secretary of War to communicate to that House “ the number of persons employed in the Indian Department as superintendents, factors, agents, subagents, interpreters, missionaries, teachers, mechanics, agriculturists, explorers, surveyors, messengers or expresses, with their names; what number of said persons hold appointments directly from the Government; what number from Governors of Territories, superintendents, and agents, with the pay and emoluments of each; also, the amount of moneys put into the hands of each Governor, superintendent, and agent, since the 1st of January, 1820, to defray the expenses of that department, and how it has been applied;” I have the honor to transmit, herewith, reports of the Second Auditor and of the Superintendent of Indian Trade. In relation to the salaries of blacksmiths, it is proper to remark, that, although, in many instances, they appear to be high, yet it has been found impracticable to reduce them. I enclose a correspondence with General Mitchell, in relation to the smith and striker employed by him at the Creek agency, whose salary is higher than at any other place, which states his reasons for believing it could not be reduced. It is also proper.to remark, that the sum of $10,000, appropriated for the civilization of the Indians, has been applied, by subscriptions, to such establishments as have been formed by benevolent societies or individuals for the purpose of their instruction; and in no instance have teachers or agriculturists been employed by this Department. For the details of the mode of the application of this sum, 1 would respectfully refer the House to the report of this Department to the President of the United States, communicated by him to Congress this session. [See No. 182.] I have the honor to be your obedient servant, J. C. CALHOUN. Hon. PHILIP P. BARBOUR, Speaker of the House of Representatives.

WILLIAM LEE, Auditor. SIR:	CREEK AGENCY, October 24, 1820. Enclosed, herewith, I have the honor to transmit an abstract of expenditure at this agency for the quarter ending on the 18th instant. In your letter acknowledging the receipt of my abstract for the quarter ending the 18th July last, you intimate a desire that something might be deducted from the item for a “ blacksmith and striker;” and, on a minute inquiry and estimate of the different items composing that charge, the result is unfavorable to any reduction. The following statement of particulars will the better enable you to decide on the propriety of this charge, viz: Blacksmith, per quarter, ------ $100 00 Board, washing, and lodging, $12 per month, -	-	-	-	36 00 $136 00 Striker, per quarter, -	-	-	-	-	-	62 50 Board, washing, and lodging, $10 per month, -	-	-	-	30 00 92 50 Shop and coal, per quarter,	-	-	-	-	-	-	20 00 $248 50 The present smith is a young man from the north, and has intimated his intention of not continuing at his present wages; and I am very confident that, if he withdraws, I cannot hire a white man in Georgia for less, if I can for that. I have a smith and striker of my own, (two black men,) employed at my place in Georgia; but I could not take less for them than the estimate. If, however, you think the charge too high, you will please to alter it to any amount you may deem reasonable, and I will endeavor to procure the men for that sum; and, if I fail, will then report the facts as they may exist. I am, &c. D. B. MITCHELL, Agent for Indian Affairs. The Hon. J. C. CALHOUN. SIR:	OFFICE OF INDIAN TRADE, January 19, 1822. In compliance with your request of the 16th instant, I have the honor to enclose a statement showing the number of persons employed in our Indian relations, as far as relates to the trade department, &c. The amount stated to be drawn from the Treasury (viz: $20,050) overreaches the appropriation $350, which, if not provided for bylaw, will be paid out of the trade fund, and will therefore reduce the demand upon the Treasury to $19,700. I have the honor to be, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant, THOMAS L. McKENNEY, Superintendent of Indian Trade. To the Hon. SECRETARY OF WAR.
