To the House of Representatives:	WASHINGTON, January 4, 1821. In compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 15th of December last, requesting “the President of the United States to cause to be laid before that House a statement of expenditures and receipts in the Indian department; also, the nature and extent of the contracts entered into, and with whom, from the 2d of March, 1811, to the present period,” I now transmit a letter from the Secretary of War, with a report of the superintendent of Indian trade, which contain the information desired. JAMES MONROE. DEPARTMENT OF WAR, January 3, 1821. The Secretary of War, to whom was referred the resolution of the House ofllepresentatives of the 15th ultimo, requesting the President of the United Stares “ to cause to be laid before this House a statement of expenditures and receipts in the Indian department; also, the nature and extent of the contracts entered into, and with whom, from the 2d of March, 1811, to the present period,” has the honor to transmit, herewith, a report of the superintendent of Indian trade, which comprehends all the information that can be furnished by the Department of War. J. C. CALHOUN. To the PRESIDENT OP THE UNITED STATES. SIR:	OFFICE OF INDIAN TRADE, December 26, 1820. I have the honor, in compliance with your note of the 19th instant, submitting to me the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 15th instant, requiring “ a statement of expenditures and receipts in the Indian Department; also, the nature and extent of the contracts entered into, and with whom, from the 2d of March, 1811, to the present period,” with a“ request to be furnished with the information required,” herewith to enclose abstract A, showing the amount of receipts and expenditures from April 1, 1811, to 31st December, 1820, for each year, inclusive, with their respective headings. The 1st of April is recognised as it begins a quarter; and the difference in time, it is presumed, will not be considered important, especially as the previous month is in the same order, and embraces no new items. The 31st of December has been reached, so as to take in the period required by tbe resolution, and make out the last quarter of this year, by resorting to estimates for a part of the quarter. In reply to the second division of the resolution, embracing a call for “ the nature and extent of the contracts entered into, and with whom,” for the same period, I have the honor to subjoin a copy of my letter to the honorable the Secretary of the Treasury, marked B, furnished at his request, under a similar call of the House of Representatives of the 10th April last. This copy is given because it refers to papers which accompanied this letter, and are, therefore, not now in my possession, but which, it is presumed, are in the hands of the Committee on Indian Affairs of last year. The committee, having this copy, can more easily recognise the said papers by the corresponding letters of reference which they bear. There has been no contract entered into with any person since the date of this letter. I have the honor to be, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant, THO. L. McKENNEY, Superintendent Indian Trade. To the Hon. JOHN C. CALHOUN, Seeretary of War.

OFFICE OF INDIAN TRADE, December 26, 1820. THOMAS L. McKENNEY, Superintendent. INDIAN AFFAIRS.	[No. 172. B. SIR:	OFFICE OF INDIAN TRADE, April 14, 1820. In reply to your request of the 12th instant, to be furnished, as soon as possible, with the information required by a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 10th instant, “ in relation to so much of said resolution as embraces the nature and extent of the contracts entered into by this office; also, the amount of debts due, and by whom,” 1 have the honor to submit the accompanying papers, marked A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and K. These being copies of the original contracts, (although those marked G and H are all that are entitled to be so called,) will show their “ nature and extent,” and with whom made. Papers marked L and M will show the amount of moneys due to this office, and by whom. It may not be deemed irrelevant to this inquiry to remark, that contracts are seldom resorted to. A knowledge of the existence of a demand for any description of articles generally implies a correspondent ability to supply it. This office has always, in addition to the employment of agents in our principal commercial cities, whose correspondence furnishes a knowledge of the state of the markets, given information to all persons who have requested it ns to the particular articles in which it usually deals; furnishing, when required, samples of the same. Hence, but little difficulty has existed in realizing the necessary supplies by the arrival of the season in which it is proper to transport them. Any interruption or failure to provide the suitable supplies, by the arrival of the season for transportation, would involve, not only great disappointment, but much suffering and excitement amongst the Indians for whom they are destined. This is one of the reasons why it is deemed necessary to avoid, as much as possible, any mode of providing the articles necessary for the supplies that should involve the slightest contingency. The forfeiture and recovery of the penalty usually affixed to contracts for failure to comply with their conditions furnishes no equivalent in such a case. Hence, merchandise suited to the wants and tastes of the Indians is procured wherever, whenever, and of whomsoever it can be had; and the storehouses of the superintendent are generally furnished with the necessary supplies by the arrival of the period at which it is usual to transport them. The route being over mountains and np rivers, the season which brings with it the best roads and the best navigation is resorted to; and it being usually of short duration, is another reason why the contingency implied in contracts is as much as possible avoided, and the markets resorted to in preference. Sometimes, when supplies are offered particularly suited to the demands of this office, if there be means to purchase them in anticipation, they are realized; it being considered safer to realize suitable goods, and goods for which it is known a demand will arise a few months in advance, than to leave them in the market, subject to be bought up, and thus removed from the control of the superintendent. Nor is it the practice of this office to make advances. This is seldom done; indeed, never, except to mechanics of known probity, to purchase the raw materials for the manufacture of particular articles, and then only on security; and in a few instances to manufacturers, as the contracts will show. Consequently, there are no debtors except thuse who become so by purchasing at the public sales of furs and peltries, on the time usually given. Such are the cases reported in paper marked L. In the quarterly returns made to the Treasury, if they shall embrace, as they often do, payments made for merchandise purchased, advances will appear to have been made, until the subsequent quarter’s returns are sent in with the invoices and vouchers, on account of which such payments were made; and which cannot always be got up and examined, and transmitted, with the returns, and in the same quarter. I have the honor to be, sir, tec. THO. L. McKENNEY, Superintendent Indian Trade. The Hon. WILLIAM H. CRAWFORD, Secretary of the Treasury. CONGRESS.]
