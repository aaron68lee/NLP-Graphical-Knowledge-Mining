No. 7. 1st Session. INDIAN TREATIES. COMMUNICATED TO THE SENATE SEPTEMBER 18, 1789. Mr. Carroll, to whom was referred a message from the President of the United States of the 17th of September, 1789, made the following report: That the signature of treaties with the Indian nations has ever been considered as a fuil completion thereof; and that such treaties have never been solemnly ratified by either of the contracting parties, as hath been commonly practised among the civilized nations of Europe: wherefore, the committee are of opinion, that the formal ratification of the treaty concluded at fort Harmar, on the 9th day of January, 1789, between Arthur St. Clair, Governor of the W estern territory, on the part of the United States, and the sachems and warriors of the Wyandot, Delaware, Ottawa, Chippewa, Pattiwatima. and Sac Nations, is not expedient or necessary; and that the resolve of the Senate, of the 8th September, 1789, respecting the said treaty, authorizes the President to enjoin a due observance thereof. That, as to the treaty made at fort Harmar, on the 9th of January, 1789, between the said Arthur St. Clair, and the sachems and warriors of the Six Nations, (except the Mohawks) from particular circumstances affecting a part of the ceded lands, the Senate did not judge it expedient to pass any act concerning the same. 1st Congress.]
