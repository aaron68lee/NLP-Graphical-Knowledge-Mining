No. 133. [1st Session. TRADE. COMMUNICATED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, JANUARY 16, 1813. War Department, January 15th, 1813. Sir: In obedience to a resolution of the honorable House of Representatives, of the 19th December last, “ requesting the President of the United States to cause* to be laid before this House, by the proper officers, a statement of the capital employed in the Indian trade; the amount of annual purchases, sales, and articles received in payment; together with the number, names, and salaries, of agents employed; the places where stationed, and specifying, as far a* practicable, the state of the trade, at each place, for the last four years;” the Secretary of War has the honor to transmit the enclosed documents and letter from the Superintendent of Indian Trade, which contain the information requested. All which is respectfully submitted. W. EUSTIS. Honorable H. Clay, Speaker of the House of Representatives. Indian Office, January Xotli, 1813. Sir:   _ _ In conformity with the resolution of the House of Representatives, of the 19th ultimo, transmitted me by you, I have the honor to state, that, of the appropriations made, at different times, for carrying on trade with the Indian tribes, to the amount of three hundred thousand dollars, ten thousand dollars remain in the treasury unapplied; so that the capital, as yet employed in the Indian trade, may be considered to be two hundred and ninety thousand dollars. The amount of annual purchases, sales, and of articles received in payment, from the 1st January, 1808, to the 30th September, 1811, will be shown by the statement, sent herewith, marked A. The number, names, and salaries of agents employed, at the ten trading houses nowin operation, and places where stationed, will be shown by the paper market! B; and the state of die trade, at each place, for the last four years,-(that is, from the 31st December, 1807, to the 30th September, 1811) is specified, as far as practicable, by the paper marked C, and the accounts to which it refers; explanatory notes have been added to each statement and account, with a view to make them as intelligible as possible. It will be seen, that, from the nature of the case, I have been often obliged to resort to estimate; the result, however, as far as it goes, is believed to be near the truth. It may be proper, sir, to remark, that, beside the property, by the returns herewith shewn, on hand at the factories, and on the way to them, or of remittances from them, unsold; the goods and cash on hand in this office, preparing for next year’s supply; together with balances uncollected for sales, and others in hands of agents, &c. form a considerable item as to the state of the general fund. With very great respect, I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servant, Honorable William Eustis, Secretary of War. J. MASON, _ Superintendent of Indian Trade. A. The following statement exhibits the amounts received by the Superintendent of Indian Trade, from the factories, in cash and drafts, and for Jars., peltries, so/rf from the 1st January, 1808, to /Ac 30/// September, 1811, wii/A ///c amount of furs, peltries, fyc. sent from the factories, then remaining unsold; also, the amount of merchandise purchased by him, and that sail of)' by him to the factories, in each year during that period. date.

The amounts purchased in the several years here taken, disagree with the amounts sent off to the factories in the same year, because of the quantity on hand in this office, at the time at which this statement is made to commence, and because of the necessity of purchasing, in quantities, the articles required, and the breaking them up and repacking, in proper assortments, for each factory. The amounts of the merchandise sent to the factories, and the amounts received for cash and drafts, and for sales of furs and peltries, &c. will be found to exceed, somewhat, as stated within, the aggregate of the same items shown by the accounts, respectively, of the ten factories now in operation, because of goods sent, and remittances received, occasionally, from each of three faclories, which were partially in operation, or were winding up, during the period taken, and now discontinued.

It lias been respectfully presumed, that the object would be best answered by the mode adopted. It will be found, that, generally, the Southern factories have lost, while the Northern factories have gained. The reason is obvious. At the first, peltries (deer skins) are in most part received from the Indians. The quantity of this article supplied in the country, greatly exceeds the home consumption. The market is on the continent of Europe. Since the obstructions to our commerce in that quarter, peltries have not only experienced a depression in price, in common with other of our produce consumed in that part of Europe, but are subject to a considerable loss by being kept over, because of the difficulty and expense of preserving from damage by vermin. At the latter, (the Northern factories) hatters’ furs are generally taken; these not exceeding the home demand, are of good sale. Anodier consideration is, that at some of the Northern factories, the Indians of their respective vicinities have been encouraged to employ a portion of labor on objects that are not attainable near the Southern factories. At fort Osage, in preparing buffalo tallow and candles; at Michilimackinac, in making maple sugar; and at fort Madison, in digring the ore, and melting down lead; in all which, they are succeeding tolerably well, as to quality and quantity. In the article of lead, remarkably well. bit. No. t. The United States' Indian Factory at fort Hawkins. 1S07. Dec. 31, 1811.

The result will be nearly the same. The Indians in that quarter having the use of money, this factory has usually been in cash, to pay salaries and other expenses on the spot; thence the large credits and small charges on these accounts; and because, also, of the peltries taken, for the last year or two, having been kept at the factory. One-half tiro debts are estimated bad; this, with Indian debts,is as little as can be counted on; yet it is indispensably necessary to credit them to a certain degree. The buildings, being remote from white settlements, must lose considerably, if disposed of; they are, therefore, estimated at half their value. co 1812-l trade. Dr. No. 2.
