NO. 142.	[1st SESSION. TRADE AND INTERCOURSE. COMMUNICATED TO THE. SENATE, ON THE 14'TH OF MARCH, 1816. v	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, March 13, 1816. In obedience to the resolution of the Senate of the 2d of March, 1815, I have the honor to transmit the enclosed documents, which exhibit the general expenses of the Indian department, embracing annuities and presents, and the general and particular views of the Indian trade, called for by the resolution. Nos. 1, 2, and 3, exhibit the amount of annuities due and payable, and the sums actually paid to the several Indian tribes within our limits; the presents made to them; and the general expenses of the Indian department during the four years preceding the 3d of March, 1815. In the sum exhibited as presents is included a great quantity of provisions furnished the friendly tribes during the war, who, upon account of their attachment to the United States, were compelled to abandon their country and take refuge within our settlements. The same cause prevented their engaging in the chase, the principal source of their supplies in times of peace. The embarrassments produced by a state of war prevented the regular payment of the moneyed part of their annuities, and, in many cases, rendered it impossible to discharge that portion which was payable in merchandise. This circumstance presented a strong inducement to furnish them liberally with those supplies which we had at command, and which were even more necessary to them than the merchandise which we were bound to furnish. It is, however, believed that these supplies have been swelled to an unreasonable amount by extensive impositions which have been practised upon the Government in the issue of provisions to them, which renders it necessary to discontinue the practice, or to devise new and suitable checks to guard against their repetition. The statements marked from A to Z exhibit the state of the fund set apart for Indian trade during the four years preceding the 31st of March, 1815. It appears from these statements that, from the commencement of the trade to the 31st December, 1809, a loss of $44,538 36 had been incurred, and that, during the period designated in the resolution, the sum of $15,906 45 had been gained, notwithstanding the loss of $43,369 61 from the capture of several of the trading posts by the enemy during the war. These two items, forming the aggregate sum of $59,276 06, may be considered as the commercial profit of the establishment during that period, which would give an annual profit of nearly $15,000. But the annual expenses paid out of the treasury in support of the establishment exceed $20,000, which presents a specific loss of more than $5,000 annually. The difference in the result of the management of this fund antecedent to the 31st of December, 1809, from that which is exhibited in these statements during the four years preceding the 31st March, 1815, is, no doubt, in a great degree the effect of the experience acquired by the prosecution of the trade. It is probable that a more intimate acquaintance with the nature of the commerce, a more skilful selection of the goods, and of the’agents employed in vending them, and a considerable increase of the capital invested in it, will, in a short time, produce a small and gradually increasing profit, after defraying all the expenses incident to the establishment, which are now payable out of the public treasury. Under the most skilful management, the profits cannot be an inducement for continuing the system now in operation. That inducement, if it exists at all, must be found in the influence which it gives the Government over the Indian tribes within our limits, by administering to their wants, increasing their comforts, and promoting their happiness. The most obvious effect of that influence is the preservation of peace with them, and among themselves. The exclusion of all intercourse between them and the whites, except those who have the permission of the Government, and over whose conduct a direct control is exercised, has insensibly contributed to this desirable object. The amelioration in their condition desired by the Government has continued to advance, but in so slight a degree as to be perceptible only after a lapse of years. If the civilization of the Indian tribes is considered an object of primary importance, and' superior to that of rapidly extinguishing their titles and settling their lands by the whites, the expediency of continuing the system now in operation, under such modifications as have been suggested by the experience already acquired, appears to be manifest. The success of such an experiment requires the exercise of all the influence which belongs to the annual distribution of annuities and presents, aided by that which must flow from a judicious supply of all their wants, in exchange for those articles which the chase and the increasing surplus of their stock of domestic animals, will enable them to procure. This influence, skilfully directed for a series of years, cannot fail to introduce among them distinct ideas of separate property. These ideas must necessarily precede any considerable advancement in the arts of civilization, and presuppose the institution of laws tu secure the owner in the enjoymeut of his individual property; because no man will exert himself to procure the comforts of life unless his right to enjoy them is exclusive. The idea of separate property in things personal universally precedes the same idea in relation to lands. This results no less from the intrinsic difference between the two kinds of property, than from the different effects produced by human industry and ingenuity exerted upon them. The facility of removing personal property from place to place, according to the will or convenience of the owner, gives to this species of property (in the estimation of the huntsman) a value superior to property in lands, which his wants as well as his habits compel him annually to desert for a considerable portion of the year. To succeed perfectly in the attempt to civilize the aborigines of this country, the Government ought to direct their attention to the improvement of their habitations, and the multiplication of distinct settlements. As an inducement to this end, the different agents should be instructed to give them assurances that, in any treaty for the purchase of lands from their respective tribes, one mile square, including every separate settlement, should be reserved to the settler, which should become a fee simple estate after the expiration of a certain number of years of actual residence upon and cultivation of it. Perhaps an additional reservation of a quarter or half-section of land to each member of such family would add to the inducements not only to make such separate settlements, but to the raising a family. If measures of this kind were adopted by the Government, and steadily pursued fur a series of years, while at the same time a spirit of libepality was exhibited in the commerce which we carry on with them, success the most complete might be confidently expected. But commerce with our Indian neighbors, prosecuted upon a contracted scale, and upon the principles of commercial profit, would tend not only to diminish the influence of the Government with them, but could not fail entirely to alienate their affections from it. A period has arrived when the trade must be greatly extended, or entirely abandoned to individual enterprise. To reserve the trade in the hands of the Government, whilst the wants of the Indians are but partially supplied, would be to make them feel its influence only in their privations and wretchedness. The right of the British Northwest Company to participate in this trade, independent of the will of the Government, is now at an end. The settlement of the lands ceded by the Creeks in 1814 will exclude the southern tribes from all intercourse with the Spanish ports in the Gulf of Florida. The preservation of peace with those tribes, as well as the execution of the plans which may be devised for their civilization, requires that this intercourse should not be renewed. The great distance of some of the tribes in the Northwest Territory, and in the northern regions of Louisiana, from the settled parts of the United States, will probably make it necessary to permit the British merchants from Canada to participate in the commerce of those tribes, until more accurate information is obtained as to their situation and numbers, their wants, and their capacity to pay for articles of the first necessity. As this knowledge is gradually acquired, and the mode of conducting the trade better understood, the exclusion of foreigners from all participation in it may be safely effected. If the trade is to be continued in the hands of the Government, the capital ought to be increased to $500,000. The exclusion from all commercial intercourse with the ports in the Gulf of Florida, aod the necessity of extending our trading establishments farther to the west and the north, with a view to the ultimate exclusion of foreign participation in it, forcibly suggest the propriety of such an increase. This capital will probably be found greatly below what is necessary to supply the wants of the various tribes within our limits. The deficiency, it is believed, will be supplied by the Northwest Company, and by individual enterprise. At present, the Governors of our Territories are compelled to give licenses to trade with the Indians to every person who can give security. The power of rejecting the application on account of the character of the applicant appears to be necessary. If the licensed traders were compelled to take an oath to observe the laws regulating Indian trade, it might aid in correcting the abuses, especially in vending spirituous liquors, which have too generally been practised by them. It is deemed expedient to establish a depot of merchandise at St. Louis, or its vicinity, under the direction of a deputy superintendent, who should have power, in addition to supplying the regular and established trading-houses, to deliver to persons of good moral character, who should be able to give security, any quantity of goods, not exceeding $10,000, for which peltries and other articles of Indian commerce should be received in payment at a fair price, and at fixed periods; or that they should be sold by the superintendent on account of the purchaser. In the latter case, a premium equal to the use and the risk of the capital should be added to the price of the goods. This, as well as several other important ideas, are more fully developed in the communication of Governor Edwards and that of the superintendent of Indian trade, which are herewith communicated, marked R and Z z. In compliance with that part of the resolution which requires my opinion of the expediency of vesting the general management of Indian affairs in a separate and independent department, I have the honor to state that an arrangement of that nature appears to me to be highly proper if the commerce of those nations is to be retained in the hands of the Government. The only rational principle upon which it is considered necessary to place the Indian trade under the control of the War Department is the necessity of relying upon it for the small military force which has hitherto been stationed at the different trading posts which have been established. This countenance and support could be given to the department to which it might be confided, with the same facility as if it still remained subordinate to the Department of War. The accounts of the superintendent of Indian trade are now returned to the Treasury Department, to which, so far, the superintendent is accountable. The accounts of the agents of the Government for the several tribes in amity with us are still returned, and settled in the War Department. From the payment of annuities to the various Indian tribes within the United States, a new species of jurisprudence has sprung up, which operates as a heavy tax upon the time of the Secretary of War. All losses of property hy American citizens, from the robberies, thefts, and depredations of those tribes, are to be remunerated out of the annuities payable to them. The evidence in all these cases is extra-judicial, and requires the examination and approbation of the Secretary before remuneration can be made. The presents which are made to them; the allowances to artificers settled among them by the Government; in fact, every disbursement of money connected with the Indian department, except in the prosecution of trade with them, has to receive the special sanction of the head of this Department. The duties incumbent upon this officer, resulting from the control of the Indian department, are so multifarious, so impossible to be reduced within general regulations, that a considerable portion of his time is necessarily devoted to them. The organization of the Accountant’s office is such as to render it impossible for that officer, by any human exertion, promptly to despatch the business which has been accumulating from year to year, until the mass has become so imposing as to render legislative aid indispensably necessary to correct the evil. The creation of a separate and independent department, to which all the Indian accounts, including those which are still settled in the Accountant’s office, will not supersede the necessity of modifications in the organization of that office. The changes which are deemed necessary to insure the prompt settlement of the accounts of the War Department are respectfully submitted to the Senate in the paper marked A z. If a new department be formed, much of the miscellaneous duties now belonging to the Department of State ought to be transferred to it. The changes which ought to be made in this regard will obtrude themselves upon the attention of the Senate whenever the subject shall be considered. It is believed that, at the present moment, no plan can be devised for carrying on the Indian trade that will be equally advantageous to the Indians, although it may be more economical to the public. This opinion is founded, in a considerable degree, upon the fact that those who have a competent knowledge, of the manner in which this trade must be prosecuted, to be successful, are destitute of the capital necessary for the prosecution to the extent demanded by the wants of the Indians. The capital of those parts of the Union where those persons are to be found is not sufficient for the purposes of commerce among themselves. It is exposed to no risks, and the profit is great; consequently, it will not be employed in commerce with the Indians. 'Jhe risks to which capital will be subject, when placed in the hands of these enterprising traders, as well from their casual want of integrity as from the robberies and thefts of the Indians, will prevent the capitalists of the commercial cities from supplying them with the means of engaging in this commerce. The proposition to establish a depot at some point about the mouth of the Missouri, for the purpose of supplying those who may be able to give sufficient security, with such an amount of goods as will enable them to prosecute the trade to advantage, will, in a series of years, produce a number of persons skilled in the manner of carrying it on successfully, and create a capital in their hands, which will be probably continued in that channel, and eventually justify the Government in leaving it, under judicious regulations, which experience will not fail to suggest, entirely to individual enterprise. These views are substantially founded upon the conviction that it is the true policy and earnest desire of the Government to draw its savage neighbors within the pale of civilization. If I am mistaken in this point—if the primary object of the Government is to extinguish the Indian title, and settle their lands as rapidly as possible, then commerce with them ought to be entirely abandoned to individual enterprise, and without regulation. The result would be continual warfare, attended by the extermination or expulsion of the aboriginal inhabitants of the country to more distant and less hnspitable regions. The correctness of this policy cannot for a moment be admitted. The utter extinction of the Indian race must be abhorrent to the feelings of an enlightened and benevolent nation. The idea is directly opposed to every act of the Government, from the declaration of independence to the present day. If the system already devised has not produced all the effects which were expected from it, new experiments ought to be made. When every effort to introduce among them ideas of separate property, as well in things real as personal, shall fail, let intermarriages between them and the whites be encouraged by the Government. This cannot fail to preserve the race, with the modifications necessary to the enjoyment of civil liberty and social happiness. It is believed that the principles of humanity in this instance are in harmonious concert with the true interest of the nation. It will redound more to the national honor to incorporate, by a humane and benevolent policy, the natives of our forests in the great American family of freemen, than to receive with open arms the fugitives of the old world, whether their flight has been the effect of their crimes or their virtues.

Sin:	KASKASKIA, ILLINOIS TERRITORY, November —, 1815. Some time in September last I had the honor to receive your letter of August 17th, with the resolution of the Senate of the United States to which it referred; but, owing to my absence from home, my engagements as a commissioner to treat with the Indians, and an attack of bilious fever, it has never been in my power till now to communicate the information which you requested. Of the annuities stipulated to be paid to the different tribes of Indians within this Territory, none has ever been sent to me, except those of the Kaskaskia tribe, which were paid within the period mentioned in the resolution of the Senate of the United States, according to a statement hereto annexed, marked No. 1. The whole amount of goods which 1 gave as presents to all the Indians within my agency, during the four years preceding the 4th of March last, is §432 03§. The Government not having furnished me with one single article, I was obliged to buy those goods at the extravagant retail prices of this country, which were nearly double what they otherwise would have cost the Government. The most of them were given at the great council which was held at Cahokia in April, 1812, with the Pattawatamies, Ottawas, Kickapoos, and Chippewas. The residue were given, on occasions that seemed absolutely to require it, to Indians belonging to the different tribes within this Territory, and to prisoners that were taken at the head of Peoria lake in the expedition of 1812. A list exhibiting the whole amount, and the dates at which the respective proportions thereof were given, is herewith transmitted, marked No. 2. In submitting to yon, agreeably to your request, the following observations upon the several questions presented in the last paragraph of the resolution of the Senate, 1 must premise that, as I do not profess to have a competent knowledge of the Indians in other parts of America to decide upon the course which it would be proper to adopt in relation to them, my remarks are intended to apply exclusively to this section of the Union, and to the Indians residing upon the Mississippi river and its waters, above this place. The first question is, “ whether any alteration of the powers and duties of the several officers and agents employed in the superintendence and management of Indian affairs would be advantageous?” That inconveniences and evils have grown out of the management and arrangements that have hitherto prevailed, experience has fully testified. But whether all these have resulted from defects in the existing laws, or from an erroneous construction of them, I shall not stop to inquire. As superintendent of Indian affairs, ex officio, by virtue of my office as Governor, it would seem that my duties and powers extended to all the Indians within the limits of this Territory; and yet a co-ordinate power in some cases, and an exclusive one in others, have been exercised by the Governor of Missouri Territory. Mr. Boilvin, the agent at Prairie du Chien, resides within this Territory, and, as I understand, all his accounts have to be submitted to the inspection and scrutiny of Governor Clark onlv. The principal residence of the Sacs is, and long has been, on Rock river; but with them nothing seems to have been left for me to do, either before or since the commencement of the late war; and without consulting me, and contrary to my most deliberate opinions, (which, as well as I now recollect, 1 had the honor of submitting to one of your predecessors,) that part of them which professed to be friendly to our Government were removed to the Osage river, in the Missouri Territory, whither also the agent (Mr. Blondeau) was called, and from whence he makes no report to me on any occasion; whereas, if he were now subject to my control, (as I think be ought to be,) my judgment greatly deceives me if I could not have him much more usefully employ ed. Mr. Forsyth was also appointed a subagent at Peoria, with instructions to report to, and receive the orders of, Governor Clark. Under all these circumstances, the exercise of co-ordinate powers by the latter gentleman and myself, according to the dictates of our respective judgments, rendered us liable to counteract each other in cases in which our views and opinions were different, and in other cases unnecessarily to multiply the expenses of the Government, by both of us pursuing the same object, when the measures adopted by one might have been sufficient; and although the mutual friendship and good understanding that have constantly existed between us have prevented any very unpleasant collisions, yet it can hardly be supposed that we have always thought exactly alike upon all subjects that were connected with our respective duties. It is therefore my' opinion that each superintendent of Indian affairs, within his respective Territory, should in all cases be the responsible head of the Indian department therein; that all other agents should be subordinate to him; and that their accounts should undergo bis examination and receive his sanction. The delivery of annuities to the Indians of one Territory by the Governor of another is calculated to produce a confliction of authority; has a tendency to lessen the influence of the superintendent within whose jurisdiction they reside, and, by putting it out of his power to retain any part of those annuities, even in those cases in which the law would justify it, diminishes the responsibility which they [he] would otherwise feel, and destroys the check which it is essential he should hold over them to restrain them from the commission nf acts of injustice, or to coerce retribution after such acts shall have been perpetrated. The Sacs, for example, have been in the habit of receiving their annuities from the Governor of the Missouri Territory. He, however, has no cognizance of any offences committed by them. Every demand for satisfaction must be made by me, as the Governor or superintendent within whose jurisdiction they reside. He therefore ought not necessarily to be presumed to know that which it is my province exclusively to inquire into. And, indeed, with the best disposition to harmonize and co-operate, cases might happen in which it would be impossible for me to communicate in time the most important information; for the want of which, the annuities might be delivered, when, according to the spirit and intention of the law, they ought to be retained. In other cases we might disagree as to the propriety of delivering them: of course, I could have no control; for he, having the power in his own hands, could execute it at pleasure. It might even sometimes be useful to excite the fears of those people, in order to make a merit of forgiving themjin cases in which it would not be absolutely necessary, and might be impolitic, to punish them; but, in losing all control over the annuities, 1 lose the most efficient engine with which to manage them, whilst the whole burden of that duty rests upon me exclusively. Besides, nothing is more injurious in the management of Indians than for them to have a father for this, and another for that purpose. Such a system is too complex for their comprehension. The management of them, to be successful, ought to be simple and perfectly uniform; and therefore I think that all annuities, wheresoever payable, ought to be delivered to them by the Governor in whose Territory they reside, or by some person known to be specially authorized by him. The powers and duties of the superintendents of Indian affairs, and all other subordinate agents, appear to be too limited for any real utility, or are very imperfectly defined by any statute law that I have seen; and if there be any common law upon the subject, it is extremely difficult to ascertain what it is. In the law “to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indians, and to preserve peace on the frontiers,” the only powers granted to the superintendents are: 1st. To grant licenses to traders/; in which he has no other discretion than to judge of the sufficiency of the security required. 2d. To revoke such licenses “for a transgression of the regulations and restrictions provided for the government of trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes.” 3d. To bring suit upon such bonds as he may have taken, for the breach of any condition therein contained. 4th. To grant licenses to purchase horses in the Indian country. And, 5th. Under the direction or instructions of the President of the United States, to demand satisfaction for wrongs done by the Indians. It is not made his particular duty, nor has he the power, to enforce any other regulations contained in the aboverecited law. Persons found in the Indian country hunting, trespassing, trading without license, or engaged in any other unlawful purpose, may be apprehended by the military force of the United States, and delivered to the civil authority. But where there is no military force at hand, or where those persons are out of the reach of it, the superintendent has no power whatever to provide for their apprehension and removal, unless by application to the civil authority for ordinary process, which in many instances he could not procure, in consequence of being unable to give the names or designate the persons of the offenders; and, if he could procure it, tew officers could be found that would execute it, or would be willing to do so for the usual compensation. In consequence of which, many such offenders pass with impunity, while those unlawful visits and intrusions have the most unhappy effect upon the Indians, who have repeatedly made them the subject of their bitterest complaints. Nothing less will do, to effectuate the. intention of the law in this particular, but a competent power of removing such persons, and a r igid execution of it. The difficulty of obtaining legal proof to convict, and the many chances of acquittal, are so great that fewpersons are deterred from those unlawful enterprises by the fear of punishment; which, when inflicted, is effected by such tardy means as never to conciliate the Indians. Even at this very time I have the. most unquestionable information that there arc a considerable number of white persons hunting on the Illinois river, within the Indian boundary, and I have reason to believe that they are principally from Portage des Sioux, in Missouri Territory, though I cannot at present ascertain the name of n single one of them. Under these circumstances, being fully impressed with the impolicy as well as injustice of permitting such conduct, I cannot avoid expressing the sincerest regret at being unable to take effectual measures for the removal of those people, and their delivery to the civil authority. There are, however, those who believe that the combined powers of Governor and superintendent would authorize me to remove them by force; but, as I have nu instructions whatever from the President to warrant it, 1 should be as unwilling to place my defence on that ground in an action of false imprisonment as if those offices were perfectly separate and distinct. The law with regard to granting licenses I also think is very defective. Any person who tenders a bond with sufficient security conditioned for the faithful observance of such regulations and restrictions as are or shall be made for the government of trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, is entitled to demand a license as a matter of right. The regulations and restrictions at present prescribed amount to little more, if any thing, than a prohibition to purchase certain articles of the Indians; and, while the most detestable and unprincipled wretches are at no loss to obtain the requisite security, they may practise conduct the most offensive to the Indians, immoral towards other traders, and injurious to the general interest of the Government, without any breach of their bonds, or without subjecting themselves to the revocation of their licenses, or to the legal refusal of new ones. The superintendent has no power to impuse additional restrictions, and therefore could not, without special instructions from the President, (which I have never received,) prohibit even temporarily the sale of ardent spirits, though such a prohibition might be imperiously required by every dictate of a rational precaution, as is now the case on the Illinois river, where the public surveyors are engaged in surveying the lands purchased by our Government of the Sacs, but which are occupied and claimed by the Pattawatamies, who have manifested tio disposition to relinquish their claim. As to the Indian agents, the law is perfectly silent with regard to their powers and duties, or those of the superintendents in relation to them; and really I have been much at a loss to know what orders 1 could legally give to those who have been directed to report to me, and receive my orders; and, in general, I have been governed more by what I conceived would conciliate the Indians, promote their happiness, and advance the interest of the Government, than by any rule expressly or constructively prescribed by law. . Upon this view of the subject, I think the superintendent of Indian affairs within each. Territory, and the agents under his direction within their respective agencies, should be specially required to superintend the faithful execution of the law “ to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indians, and to preserve pence on the frontiers;” that they should be empowered to apprehend, or cause to be apprehended, all persons who shall have violated its provisions, or be found in the Indian country without license or passport; that they should deliver, or cause to be delivered, within convenient time, all such offenders to the civil authority; and that they should be authorized to incur any expenses necessary to the due execution of those powers and duties. It is also my opinion that the discretion of the superintendent in granting licenses ought to be enlarged, and that traders ought to be required to conduct themselves peaceably and correctly towards the Indians, respectfully and dutifully towards the Government, and to abstain from the common and injurious practice of endeavoring to excite the prejudicesand hostility of the Indians towards other traders; for all which, effectual provisions ought to be made by law. Ou the second question presented in the resolution aforesaid, I do not possess the information requisite for forming a correct opinion, nor do I suppose any observations upon the. subject of it were expected from me. The third and last question is, “whether a plan may not be devised that will be equally advantageous to the Indian tribes, and more economical to the public, whereby the Indian trade may, under safeguards, be hereafter carried on by individuals or private companies, instead of the manner in which the same is now conducted?” Admitting the present plan to be well calculated both to put down British traders and to conciliate the Indians, it is evident that no important consequences can be expected to flow from it without carrying it extensively into operation; for the former object cannot be accomplished without active competition in the same market; the latter can only be beneficially secured by providing the same accommodation for all the different tribes that have equal claims; as, otherwise, the jealousy that would be excited, and tho hostility which would consequently be engendered, would render the plan totally abortive: for we certainly should gain nothing, if, in making one tribe our friends by our favors, we should make another, equally powerful and respectable, our enemies by our partiality or neglect; and I can venture to say that there are no people upon earth more jealous, or upon whom such a distinction would operate more injuriously, especially with the aid of British traders, in giving to it its highest possible effect. Goods to a great amount must, therefore, be transported to the numerous trading-houses which, upon this plan, ought to be established at many different and distant points. And, besides the danger of usual casualties, the risk in trusting to the fidelity of a multitude of agents, at all times considerable, is peculiarly so in this business. It can hardly be expected that married men of respectability would abandon their families, and desert all the comforts of civilized life, to engage in this kind of service. Single men must, therefore, be calculated on for such agencies. These, as all experience has proved, are liable to form connexions with, and to have children by, the Indian women, which, by giving birth to new attachments, produces a relish for savage life, at the same time that it destroys the inducements and interposes obstacles to a return to civil society; and instances of such effects having been produced are so common and well known, that they ought to silence all question as to the probability of their happening. Whenever, then, a man has ptade up his mind to exchange the ordinary pursuits of civil life for savage independence, he must necessarily become indifferent to the opinions of that society which he lias concluded to desert, regardless of its claims upon him, and would most probably cease to feel the influence of those motives which constitute the most efficient safeguards of honor and integrity. But independent of these considerations, if the risk of confiding in those agents is to be estimated in proportion to the temptation that is offered them, then certainly none can be greater which depends on the fidelity of man; for placed, as they must be, far in the interior of the Indian country, out of the reach of observation, and approximating British establishments in proportion to their distance from our settlements, nothing is more easy for them than to practise the greatest frauds without detection, or even to escape with the whole capital committed to their charge. A very few cases of this kind would make the trade a losing business to the Government, or require such an advance upon its goods as to take from it all advantages over individuals. But supposing that all those agents shoqjd make such remittances in furs and peltries as to prevent any loss on the part of the Government: what check is there to restrain them from defeating its benevolent intentions, by practising the greatest frauds upon the Indians, in selling the. goods to them at the most exorbitant prices? All they have to do is,1 to keep two sets of entries; or to charge themselves with such quantities of goods as they can vend, and make returns for the amount so charged. Should they al), however, act with perfect fairness and honesty, the trading-houses are notwithstanding liable to be used partially, if not extensively, as means of accommpdation to British traders themselves. For example, I will suppose that Mr. Johnson (one of the agents already appointed) shall be fortunate enough to arrive with his goods at Prairie du Chien next spring, just about the time that the British traders are ready to return to that place ■with their furs and peltries from the river St. Peter’s: he, of course, would sell much lower than they could afford to do, otherwise it would be useless for him to go there; they therefore might find it to their advantage to obtain their supplies from him, which they could do with facility, by employing some of the many Indians who always accompany them at that season of the year to trade for them; and I kuow not how it would be possible for him to detect all the schemes that might be adopted for that purpose. Such attempts, I am credibly informed, have been frequently known to succeed at Chicago, and doubtless have been practised with equal success at other public trading-houses. Upon this view of the subject, it is worthy of consideration whether sufficient encouragement to a more extensive operation of the present plan can be derived from the experiment that has already been made upon it. Limited as that may have been, it ought to be considered as a sufficient test of the efficacy of the plan in those places in which it has had full effect, and upon those Indians at least who have enjoyed the full benefit of it. For my part, I have never been able to discover, and I defy any man to specify, a solitary public advantage that has resulted from it in this country; while the melancholy fate of Chicago, the attacks upon Fort Madison, other early hostilities in its vicinity, the signal escape of the agents with the public goods from the Missouri, and the undeniable fact that, during the most successful operation of the public trading-houses at the above-mentioned places, individuals constantly vended more goods to the Indians for whose benefit those houses were established than the public agents did—all combine to afford practical demonstration that the system under consideration is neither calculated to conciliate and accommodate the Indians, nor for successful competition with British traders. An attentive consideration of the situation of the Indians, a knowledge of their customs and habits, and of the manner in which trade with them has been conducted from time immemorial, it seems to me are all that can be necessary to produce irresistible conviction that the present plan can never succeed to any great extent in this country against competition, and it surely is not an object to pursue it where there is none. The Indians having been long accustomed to obtain their supplies of goods on credit, about the usual time of their going to their wintering grounds, which are very remote from their villages, and at which they have constantly been in the habit of disposing of every thing of any consequence that they have had to sell, cannot, from their improvident character, be presumed to be prepared at those times to make prompt payment, without which the public factors could not safely sell to them; and therefore the cheapness of the goods is no advantage to them, because they are unable to avail themselves of it; while the traders who uniformly follow them to their hunting grounds are always anxious to advance their goods to them oh credit previous to their departure from their villages, and are prepared to furnish them with additional supplies afterwards. Even after they may have arrived at their hunting grounds, and acquired the means of purchasing goods, their object being more to supply present wants than to accumulate riches, it can hardly be supposed that, with their characteristic indolence, the prospect of getting goods a little cheaper would be a sufficient inducement with them to pack their furs and peltries a great distance to the factories, when they could otherwise obtain the supplies they wanted. But, besides the Inss of time (then so peculiarly important to them) which would be attendant on occasional journeys of that kind during the hunting season, there are many other insuperable objections that forbid them; and at the expiration of their hunt they have generally little, if any thing, left to dispose of. Admitting these facts to be true, (and 1 think I can very safely vouch for their correctness,) how is it possible for a factory stationary at a particular spot, and selling no goods upon credit, to compete,succcssfully with the individual enterprise which has always distinguished the British traders? But supposing the present plan could be entirely successful in putting down British traders, our own, being much less formidable, of course would also fall victims to it; and hence would result a complete monopoly of the fur trade on the part of the Government, which would tend equally to excite the odium of the citizens of this country, and to check their further enterprises in exploring the hidden resources of wealth that remain yet to be discovered; whereby any increase in the trade would be prevented, because Government would hardly establish factories at any places except those at which experience had proved they could be advantageously employed; individuals would he deterred from making new establishments, lest, if their experiment succeeded, they might again be superseded by the Government; and thus would be lost to the nation advantages of immense importance, if any calculations can be made upon them from the enterprise of six men only, in the course of last year, who then made discoveries equal to any that ever were made in the prosecution of the fur trade, within the space of twelve months, since the first settlement of America. The operation of the monopoly that would thus be effected, as I understand the plan of the Government, is not to make any profit by it; so that, while those citizens who have hitherto depended upon the fur trade for the support of their families would be entirely thrown out of the only business which they understand; they could not even console themselves with the prospect of participating with the nation at large in the profits of which that trade is susceptible; these would be entirely sacrificed by the Government for the purpose of preserving peace with the Indians; and as I think that less than the amount of those profits, for a single year, otherwise employed, would be abundantly more efficacious, whenever occasion might require it, it appetirs to me to be a useless waste of the resources of the nation to make such an immense sacrifice for a number of years in succession, without any occurrence in the mean time indicating even an apparent necessity for it; and when, too, the prospects of a rupture must be daily diminishing by the rapid increase of population on our frontiers, and by the fears with which it will necessarily inspire the Indians. It is believed, however, that as the principal object in establishing the present plan was to drive British traders, by fair competition, out of our limits, and thereby to get rid of their troublesome machinations with the Indians, Government would no longer prosecute it after those objects should be accomplished. But suppose it already to have succeeded fully to that extent, it nevertheless would not have annihilated British capital, or the Northwest Company, or that of Hudson’s Bay. What then is to prevent the British traders from returning among us after the factories shall be withdrawn? Certainly nothing that I can conceive of. To succeed to the extent I have supposed would necessarily require the lapse of some years. In the mean time, our traders, from necessity, would have sought other employments, while our engagés and voyageurs, (as the hirelings of Indian traders are called,) who are so accustomed and devoted to the Indian trade as to be, like sailors, fit for little else, would most probably, from the want of employment, have gone over to the British, and entered into their service; and, consequently, our own citizens would then be even less qualified than they are at present to enter into successful competition with our rivals. Having satisfied myself, at least, that the Government must encounter serious and important risks in the prosecution of the present plan of conducting the Indian trade; that it never can succeed in accomplishing the objects for which it was established, or produce any other advantages equivalent to those risks; and that, if it could succeed to the full extent of the wishes and anticipations of its most sanguine supporters, it would be attended with sacrifices which are forbidden by the public interest, it is, consequently, my opinion that it would be good policy to abandon it, even if no substitute should be provided in its place. If, however, the Government is disposed to continue its own immediate agency in the Indian trade, its first care should be to obtain goods, particularly the important articles of blankets and cloths, of equal quality to those that are carried into the Indian market by our rivals, which never has been heretofore done in a single instance. For this purpose, it might be advisable to establish a manufactory of those articles, to be placed under the special direction and management of the superintendent of Indian trade. But if this is impracticable, and suitable impurtations cannot be made from England, I should suppose it would not be difficult to obtain samples of the English goods, and have such articles as we require sufficiently well manufactured in France. I would also recommend the establishment of a factory at St. Louis, whither all the goods intended for the Indians of the Mississippi river and its waters should be sent; for the management of which factory, a deputy superintendent of Indian trade should be appointed, with power to dispose of the goods to such traders as could give good security for the punctual payment of the price agreed upon, and also for their compliance with such regulations and restrictions as might be prescribed to them. By this means the danger of trusting to the fidelity of a great number of subordinate agents would be avoided; the goods, when sent into the Indian country, would not be at the risk of the Government; and as the sales to the Indians, on this plan, would be much more rapid, the price of the goods could of course be the sooner refunded. Those traders would be obliged to employ a great number of engagés, who as well as themselves would be interested in conducting the trade and intercourse with the Indians in such a manner as to conciliate their friendship, and therefore might be relied upon as the most efficient and faithful agents of the Government, especially under their dependance upon it for further credits. At the same time numbers of the Canadian engagés and voyageurs, invited by the prospects of employment which the operation of this plan would afford, would readily engage in our service, which, for many obvious reasons, they decidedly prefer to that of the British. This, by increasing our means of conducting the trade, while it would lessen those of our opponents, would do them the most essential injury; for nothing enables them to prosecute the fur trade with success so much as the great number of their engagés and voyageurs, the low price at which they are hired, and the easy manner in which they are usually paid. As an example of which, it is within my own personal knowledge that the whole expense of transporting eight thousand weight of goods from Montreal to the Mississippi, wintering with the Indians, and returning with a load of furs and peltries in the succeeding season, including the cost of provisions and portages, and the hire of five engagés for the whole time, does not exceed five hundred and twenty-five dollars, much of which is usually paid to those engagés when in the Indian country, in gotids, at an exorbitant price. If, therefore, the plan which I have the honor to suggest be calculated only to weaken our opponents in those essential resources, its absolute certainty of producing that effect, and pretty extensively too, would be sufficient to recommend its adoption. Whatever plan our Government may adopt, it is, I think, but reasonable to suppose that the British Government will endeavor to counteract it; therefore, as a further illustration of this subject, I will suppose our present plan adhered to, and the one I now recommend adopted by the British Government, and put into execution at the island of St. Joseph’s. On this supposition, Mr. Johnson (our factor) arrives at Prairie du Chien next autumn with his $10,000 worth of goods; Mr. Dickson, having obtained an equal quantity at St. Joseph’s, reaches the Indian villages about the same time. Both of these gentlemen are bound to refund to their respective Governments the cost of the goods, including the expense of transportation. The Indians to whom they must vend them are, the Menomonies, Winne- bagoes, Sacs, Foxes, Chippewas, and Sioux, (the very Indians intended to be supplied by our factor.) The former remains stationary at Prairie du Chien, selling only to those Indians who go there prepared to make prompt payment; the latter pursues the usual course of the trade, and sends his engagés to winter with the Indians on their hunting grounds. Can any man in this world, at all acquainted with the geography of the country, the situation and habits of the Indians, and the history of the fur trade, hesitate to believe that, under such circumstances, the latter gentleman would be able to sell the most goods, to obtain the best price, and to make the earliest payment to his Government? The only advantage which the British really enjoy over us, consisting in the number of their engagés, would be daily diminishing, not only by the operation of the plan I recommend, in withdrawing those people from their service, but in its tendency to create new engagés and voyageurs out of our own citizens; while our superior facilities of transportation by large navigable rivers would eventually give us success throughout the whole extent of our limits at least. If Government should determine upon declining all further direct agency in the Indian trade, I would, in that case, recommend the legal incorporation of a company at St. Louis, with power to raise a competent capital for that purpose; and, among the conditions of incorporation, it should be provided that the company should buy, at a reasonable price, all the Indian goods which the Government might then have on hand, and should keep up tradinghouses at those places at which we are bound by treaty to continue them. It might also be useful to invest the company with the privilege of employing a part of its capital in banking; but, not knowing whether the principle of either of those plans will be approved, I forbear any remarks upon minuter details. If neither of them should be thought advisable, and Government is disposed tu foster the trade in the hands of individuals, this, I should suppose, might be done by allowing a drawback of all duties upon goods exported to the Indian country, which could be effected, without danger of fraud or evasion, by checks that might be interposed through the instrumentality of the present public agents: fur example, I will suppose that a trader wishes toexpurt his goods to the villages of the Sioux and Chippewas above Prairie du Chien; he might be required to enter his goods by invoice of articles, instead of packages, with the superintendent at St. Louis, and again to have both goods and invoice re-examined by Mr. Boilvin,our agent at Prairie du Chien: by this means, it would be seen whether he had carried the whole quantity of goods as far as the latter place; and if he had done so, there would be no danger of his bringing them back, as there is no probability that any person would carry goods that far merely for the purpose of fraudulently getting clear of the duty on them. This example, however, is stated merely to show that the proposed indulgence could be safely given by the Government to a certain extent at least; and, as far as it could be so given, it would certainly be attended with beneficial consequences. I have myself matured no plan upon the subject; but I suppose the drawback might be safely and advantageously allowed upon all goods exported from certain points on the Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois rivers; and the points that I should recommend would be. the mouth of Rock river, on the Mississippi; Fort Osage, on the Missouri; and Fort Clarke, on the Illinois; at each of which places I presume an Indian agent will be continued, so that this plan could be effected without the expense of any additional agencies. If the present plan of the Government should be abolished, and either of those which I have the honor to recommend substituted in its place, I have no doubt that we shall soon see the fur trade floating exclusively in the channels which nature seems to have prepared for it. Being, however, sensible of my own want of information upon the subject, and believing that no man in America was better qualified to decide upon the best plan of conducting that trade than Colonel Chouteau, who has pursued it in this country for forty years with such success as to have amassed an immense fortune by it, I took the liberty of asking, and readily obtained, his opinion in writing, which I have the honor herewith to transmit for your consideration. Very respectfully, sir, vour most obedient servant, N1NIAN EDWARDS. The Hon. WILLIAM H. CRAWFORD, Secretary of War, Washington City. NOTES. The new method of conducting the Indian trade, for several years past, is the cause of a considerable diminution in the fur trade of the Missouri and Illinois Territories. The Government of the United States thought that, by establishing a system of factories, they would supply all the tribes of Indians, to their satisfaction, with all kinds of goods necessary for their consumption, at such low prices that by these means they would get all the furs and pelts of the Indians, and at the same time would also get their confidence, esteem, and fidelity. But, unhappily, this generous system has had a contrary effect. The diminution of the Indian proceeds, on the one part, and the diminution also of esteem and fidelity in almost all the tribes of Indians towards us in the late war, prove incontestably that the system of factories is not at all proper to conciliate the esteem of the Indians, and less so to obtain in the fur trade a preference over the strangers. This kind of trade and the trade among whites are entirely different, and to consider them analogous would be erring considerably. It requires on the part of the trader a complete knowledge of the Indian customs, characters, habits, way of living, hunting, &c., to form his plans to trade with them, without which one will always err and fall from errors to errors. The factories, such as they are now established, are trading-houses fixed at certain points under the protection . of a fort, and more or less distant from the Indian villages. Though living at a considerable distance from those houses, Indians are obliged to go to them to trade. They get in exchange for their furs goods at a reasonable price, (however, the difference with strangers is only in powder, rifles, calicoes, saddles, wampum, and a few other articles.)	, These factories never sell on credit,* whereas, for many years past, Indians have been accustomed to buy in that way, as well from the traders of these two Territories as from the British. The credits are actually indispensable, because the hunting grounds .being further than they formerly were, and Indians being obliged to go more than 300 miles from their villages to hunt, if they have not a sufficient quantity of furs to buy their winter goods, they miss their hunt, because it is too hard for them, once on the hunting spot, to return in winter to the factories, through snow and frost, to trade for whatever they want to continue their hunt; and what stops them the most is, the fear of leaving their families alone, exposed to war parties from the other tribes that are constantly going about in the winter season; and themselves, in going to the factories, are exposed to fall into the hands of their enemies: this having already been the case. The great advantages that the British traders have obtained over the factories on the Mississippi are very well known; but to give an idea of them, I will suppose four British traders going to trade with a certain tribe of Indians; these four traders will certainly be in competition one against the other, and every one of them will try to do the best business; to do which they will carry with them what the Indians love the best in every way, and open their stores in the village of that tribe. Does it start to hunt, they follow it by water from 150 to 200 miles, until the place where it stops to go in the interior of the lands. There the traders build houses, and a part of the Indians ther cabins or lodges. Each Indian hunter buys on credit, sometimes to the amount of $200, according to his reputation. Each trader does his best to sell on credit to those hunters, because it is a custom with the Indians that a family who has obtained goods on credit sells all its furs to the man who has advanced those goods. When the Indian hunters have left the river shore and are on their hunting ground, soon after, the traders try their best to get Partial credits are given at the factories.—John Mason, Superintendent of Indian Affairs. the furs of those Indians that have not bought on credii; to do that, they send in every direction, to the places fixed upon by the Indians to hunt, men with fancy goods. These men or engagés carry those goods on their shoulders through frost and snow, and do whatever is in their power to trade for the furs of those Indians that have not bought on credit from their employers or bourgeois, (it is what the Indian traders call running a deouine.) I have gone through this long detail about the British traders, to show all the pains and means they make use of to obtain from the Indians their furs, and that, if we want to go into competition with them, we must do the same; for to be stable on a certain fixed point is giving positively to the strangers all kind of advantages in this kind of trade. In the event of the abolition of the factories, the first inquiry that naturally presents itself is, what is to be substituted-in place of them! Upon this subject, I must, in the first place, refer to a publication in the Ohio Navigator, which was written by me in 1805, and published in 1811, folio 268, and was the result of fifteen years’ observation and experience by myself. In that publication it will be seen that the Missouri only gave annually at that time an amount of $77,971. The same produce would fetch now at least one-third more, on account of the difference in prices; add to this sum the proceeds of the following rivers, St. Peter’s, Red, Crow’s Wing, and a great many more of the Mississippi that are not comprehended in the observations of 1805, then the sale of furs and peltries could be safely estimated annually (independent of the proceeds of all the trade with the Indian tribes of the Missouri above the Mahas and Poncas) at $150,000 at least. To obtain all these furs, Government ought to establish at St. Louis a store, with a capital of about $100,000, which ought to be augmented according to the augmentation of the trade. That store ought to be furnished with all kinds of goods suited to the Indian trade, well assorted in quality and quantity, and the articles in proportion to the sum. These goods ought to be selected on the notes of a man who understands perfectly well the Indian trade, and who should also know exactly what suits every nation in particular. That store, so established, could equip (without exclusive privilege) for the present about twenty-five or thirty traders for the Missouri, Mississippi, and all the rivers that empty in these two. But to enable those traders so equipped to enter into competition with the British traders, Government ought, as much as possible, to sell these • goods at a very moderate advance, and take their furs and peltries at a reasonable price. By these means Government would employ its capital to the advantage of its citizens, to the annoyance of British tradets, and I am bold to say it is the only means to destroy the British trade; besides which, our two Territories would be greatly benefited thereby. Twenty-five or thirty traders would employ about two hundred men. The necessary expenses of shipping, and some other expenses, would produce the circulation of a trading medium in the country. Add to these the advantage of forming voyageurs fit for those sorts of voyages, which, by the bye, will certainly be of great consequence. In the above notes I have not mentioned the Indian tribes which live above the Mahas and Poncas; these are the Sioux, divided in several tribes and under different names, the Arickaras, Mandans, Gros Ventres (Big Bellies,) Pieds Noirs (Black Feet,) and a great many others who are little known that inhabit the forks of the Missouri; and particularly those of the leftside, which are very near the trading-houses of the Northwest Company of Canada: as to those of the. right fork, on which there is a fall, known only since the voyage of Captains M. Lewis and William Clark, their journal can be consulted. The trade with those tribes cannot be made with any advantage but by a company well organized, and which could dispose annually of about $50,000 in goods, of which sum the company could not expect any good returns before the expiration of three years, that time being necessary to go to and examine the country, build forts on the places which would be thought convenient, make friends, and open the trade with those different tribes. I dare give here my decided opinion, which is founded on premises that I believe just, that a company well conducted, which should have the Indian trade (not exclusively) from Cedar island, above the Poncas, to all the forks of the Missouri, could bring down annually, (once well established,) from that extent of country, a considerable sum in furs aod pelts, which could be estimated at more than $200,000. This sum will appear exaggerated, but I found my opinion on the returns of the Northwest Company of Canada, which, though not well known, on account of the profound silence they have kept on this subject, have been thought, through the observations of knowing men, to be at least £200,000 sterling; and this sum is principally got by the trade carried on with those tribes of Indians that reside in the neighborhood of the branches on the left side of the Missouri. To arrive at those trading places, that company incurs very great expenses, which are occasioned by the difficulty of the roads, being obliged to carry their goods in very small bark canoes; and when there is no water, those goods are carried on men’s shoulders. The greatest difficulty for them, and which occasions a very great expense, is the carriage of their provisions to the different forts they have on that part of the northwest. The proposed company would have a decided advantage over that of the Northwest, because it would be able to carry its goods wherever it would fix its forts, in large barges, which would save considerable time and expense, as well for sending up their goods and food as for bringing down their produce. It might yet establish easily a fort near the village of the Mandans, or any other place which might be thought proper, and there plant corn, potatoes, &c., which would diminish greatly the expenses of transportation, and even make whiskey, this liquor being indispensable in this kind of trade. With these advantages, added to many others, the proposed company must annoy and even destroy the Northwest Company; but whoever undertakes this trade may be sure that the Northwest Company will do any thing in its power, and even sacrifice large sums of money, to prevent that establishment. But if the agents of the proposed company, that would be at the head of the business in the neighborhood of the Northwest Company, should act prudently, and have engagés that know well the trade, all the efforts of the Northwest Company would amount to nothing. The mountains that are on the west side of the Missouri Territory offer riches more considerable than those of all the rest that have been mentioned, and the more advantageous, as there would be no competition on the part of any strangers. That country, covered by a great many Indian tribes, such as Laytanes, Rapahauts, Toquibacoux, and many others, wish and ask constantly to open a trade with us. But, unhappily, we have not yet capitalists and men of enterprise in these Territories; but we may hope that some will come, when this country will be well known, and when people will appreciate its great resources in riches that arc immense, which time and the enterprise of our citizens cannot fail to develop. Y. SIR:	INDIAN OFFICE, February 9, 1816. In obedience to the instructions of the President, I have prepared, in conformity to the resolution of the Senate of the United States, and have the honor to transmit you herewith, a view of the trade carried on for public account with the several Indian tribes within the limits of the United States, during the four years preceding the spring of 1815. By the mode of accounting at this office, the returns of the agents are made quarterly, and the books are struck to conform with these dates. In order to avoid fractional calculation in furnishing balances, I have taken the liberty to make it commence on the 1st of April, (the beginning of a quarter,) instead of the 4th of March, 1811, as contemplated by the resolution. Since the period embraced will be, within a very few days, the same, there can be no perceptible difference in the result. The schedule marked Z refers to and gives the substance of each of the several papers of which this view is made up. In addition to an annual account of each of the trading-houses, and an annual account of the whole of the Indian trade, and a general account of the same during the period before mentioned, as called for by the resolution, for the better understanding of the whole subject I have furnished a general account of each trading-house, and a statement showing the amount of property on hand, or of the capital stock as it stood on the 1st of April last. It necessarily happens that in a concern, the business of which is going on at so many different and distant points, the accounts cannot be struck at any given time without having resort in many of the items to estimate. This is particularly the case in the annual statements, inasmuch as, from the nature of this trade, the returns of an outfit cannot conte in within the same year, and are often out more than two years. The results, however, may be considered as nearly correct. It will be perceived by these statements that, in the year 1811, there were ten trading-houses in operation, and that in the beginning of 1815 there remained no more than six. Four, to wit, that at Michilimackinac, that at Chicago, that at Sandusky, and that at Fort Wayne, were broken up and destroyed by the enemy. To replace these, in part, during last fall two new houses were fitted out, one to be located at Chicago, and one on Green bay of Lake Michigan. With great respect, I have the honor to be, sir, your very obedient, humble servant, J. MASON. The Hon. WILLIAM H. CRAWFORD, Secretary of War. Z.

A z. The office of Accountant of the War Department was established under the act of 8th May, 1792. The duties of the Accountant were the settlements of all accounts relative to the pay of the army, the subsistence of officers, bounties to soldiers, expenses of the recruiting service, and the incidental and contingent expenses of the War Department. All purchases for supplying the army with provisions, clothing, supplies in the quartermaster’s department, military stores, Indian goods, and all other supplies or articles for the use of the War Department, were directed to be made by the Treasury Department, and the accounts were rendered to that Department, and were settled by the Recounting officers, without any agency of the Accountant. The business of the Accountant’s office was confined to the duties prescribed by the act of the 8th May, 1792, until the year 1798. On the 16th July of that year, Congress passed “ An act to alter and amend the several acts for the establishment and regulation of the Treasury, War, and Navy Departments,” by which the duties heretofore performed by the accounting officers of the Treasury Department, in relation to the settlement of the accounts for supplying the army with provisions, clothing, supplies in the quartermaster’s department, military stores, Indian goods, and all other supplies or articles for the use of the War Department, were annexed to those of the Accountant, making it his duty to settle accounts of every description growing out of the military service of the United States, agreeably to the estimates and appropriations for the military establishment, and also for the Indian department, including the Indian annuities. By the act of the 3d March, 1809, “ further to amend the several acts for the regulation of the Treasury, War, and Navy Departments,” the duties of the Accountant’s office were further increased, by reason of the forms prescribed for keeping and rendering the accounts of the War Department. An additional set of books for the appropriations, and also one for the expenditures, were directed to be kept in the Accountant’s office. In the former, accounts of the appropriations made annually are kept under each specific appropriation, showing the moneys drawn from the Treasury, and their application, annual statements of which are rendered to Congress. In the books of expenditure, separate accounts are kept with every receiver of public money, under each specific appropriation, out of which the money is advanced, and separate accounts are required to be rendered by each agent or receiver of public money, under every specific appropriation, out of which moneys are advanced to them. Hence, the number of personal accounts and separate settlements is multiplied to a very great extent. Formerly, (that is, prior to this act,) every agent or receiver of public money rendered but one account, and bad but one settlement, whether he received money under one or more appropriations; now, it frequently occurs that the commissaries, quartermasters, paymasters—in short, all disbursing agents—have from two to six, and some more, accounts open on the buoks; and every recruiting officer has at least two accounts on the books, which require separate settlements under each. Other duties are required of the Accountant under the same law, which consume much time, and occasion great labor, particularly when the expenditures of the Department have extended the number of accounts to what they are at present. The annual list of outstanding balances required to be laid before the Comptroller of the Treasury may be mentioned; and when the open accounts on the books of the Accountant exceed five thousand, some estimate may be formed of the labor and difficulty incident thereto. Without, therefore, going any further into the details of the duties of the Accountant’s office, it may be safely stated that some alteration has become necessary to meet the present state of public business. It is, accordingly, recommended that a division of the duties of the Accountant be made, and that an additional accounting officer be appointed, to be charged with the performance of such part of them as may be prescribed by law, leaving the residue to be performed by the Accountant. By an arrangement of this kind, the business of each office will be placed within the reasonable bounds of punctual performance. The great mass of unsettled accounts, as well those already deposited in the several offices of the War Department, and remaining unsettled, as those unliquidated in every part of the country, and those about to be provided for by Congress, will be settled within a reasonable period, and in a manner calculated to secure the public interest in their adjustment. Without some arrangement of this kind, it will be impracticable to meet the public business; and the consequent delays in the settlement of the public accounts, particularly those of paymasters, quarterpiasters, and other agents, whose disbursements have been to a large amount, will operate greatly to the prejudice of the public interest. There is another part of the present system, in relation to the accounts of the War Department, which it is thought may be altered with advantage to the public interest; and, with a view of elucidating that part, it is necessary again to resort to the act of the 8th May, 1792, establishing the Accountant’s office. In that act, it is directed that the Accountant shall report all settlements made by him, from time to time, to the accounting officers of the Treasury, for inspection and revision. The accounts are accordingly settled by the Accountant, the balances are paid, and thereafter quarter-yearly sent to the Treasury, accompanied by statements in detail, embracing all the transactions of the office in relation to the moneys received and expended. These statements have grown to an extent, in consequence of the increased expenditures in the War Department, so as to cause, in their preparation, a great consumption of time and much labor. The accounts and vouchers settled being sent out of the office, and filed at the Treasury, is also an inconvenience, because it very generally happens that, on the settlement of an officer’s or agent’s account, the previous settlement becomes necessary; this must be sent for to the Treasury, and cannot always be had: hence delay in the business of the office. But the principal objection to this part of the system is, the labor it occasions in preparing the accounts for revision; notwithstanding which, the object to be effected by it-does not appear of sufficient importance to justify its continuance. The accounts are never revised until months after they have been settled, the balances paid, and the claimant acquitted of his responsibility. If, therefore, errors or improper allowances should be discovered, the difficulty of correcting the one, or altering the other, must appear obvious: hence the insufficiency of the revision at the Treasury. It is, therefore, thought the more advisable that an officer should be appointed in the War Department to act as Comptroller, whose duty it should be to revise the accounts settled by the Accountant, before the balances are paid, or the accounts considered finally settled. This would supersede the necessity of sending the accounts to the Treasury for revision, would be the means of keeping in each office the accounts settled in it, and remove all the difficulties incident to the revision at the Treasury. It would also be the means, it is conceived, of securing the public interest, by withholding the payment of money until the accounts had received every check necessary to an accurate settlement. It might also be made this officer’s duty to perform such other acts, as far as they are applicable in relation to the War Department, as the Comptroller of the Treasury now performs in relation to that Department; and the same officer might be clothed with power to decide on accounts not specifically provided for by law, and which now are referred to the Secretary of War, to the great interference with his other duties. In short, the appointment of a Comptroller for the War Department would be the means of concentrating in that Department the whole responsibility growing out of its receipts and expenditures, and of relieving the officers of the Treasury Department of a branch of duty which must very materially interfere with the performance of their other high and important duties. Z z. SIR:	INDIAN OFFICE, March G, 1816. I had the honor to receive yesterday your letter of the 4th instant, in which I aru requested to furnish you with my views of the expediency of continuing the Indian trade as now established; of the modifications which it would be proper to introduce into that system at this time; of the increase of capital which is necessary to the supply of the numerous tribes within our limits; and of the alterations, if any, that should be made in the system of licensing private traders. As to the first three objects of inquiry, I respectfully offer the opinion that it would not be expedient at this time to abolish the present system of trade on public account, but that it should be continued, with some modifications and an increase of capital. However desirable it may be to relinquish ultimately to individuals all the trade with the Indians, it is believed that this cannot yet be done with propriety. If it is the policy of the Government, as it is presumed certainly to be, no longer to permit any trade or intercourse to be held by foreigners with the Indians within our limits, it becomes very questionable whether the amount of supplies heretofore furnished these in many parts of our territories by British traders can, within any short period, be substituted by American traders, independently of public aid. If British traders are prohibited, and the supplies before obtained from them cannot be had by other means, it is very certain the Indians must suffer greatly, and that, besides the inhumanity of such a result, no circumstance could tend more to alienate them from this Government. The Indian trade is of a peculiar character, and requires certain associations of local information and habit on the one hand, and of capital and perseverance on the other, that cannot be at once matured in such manner as that it be carried on for private account in all the different sections of the country, to the necessary extent, in any short time. Again: it would be difficult, perhaps impossible, so to organize a system of trade purely on public account, as that it should pervade the villages and the hunting camps of the numerous tribes within our limits, (a course, by usage, become indispensable,) without exposing the public funds engaged in it to too great risk of loss by its complexity, or from fraud in the numerous and distant subagencies which would thus, of necessity, be created. For these considerations, I would, with great deference, propose that the present capital in Indian trade (which may be considered to be now equal, or nearly equal, to the sum originally vested, to wit, $290,000,) be increased to $500,000; and that the superintendent of Indian trade be authorized, besides opening additional trading-houses at such convenient positions as may be directed by the President, to establish a depot of supplies, duly assorted for the Indian trade, at some proper place, neighboring to the Indian country, as at St. Louis, equal in amount to about $150,000, to be furnished from time to time on credit for a reasonable term, bot under strict regulations as to ultimate security and the character of the persons intrusted, to American traders, who should come under engagement to barter the goods so obtained at the villages and hunting grounds of such tribes as might be designated to them, respectively; these credits to be given out in moderate sums, proportioned to the means of the trader, and made reimbursable at the depot, in the furs and peltries received from the Indians, at fair prices, such as would at the same time support the public fund, and give sufficient encouragement to the adventurer. This part of the trade might be so regulated as to leave the public trading-houses, which are stationed at snme distance beyond the white settlements, to be resorted to by such of the Indians as should keep over the products of their hunts, and convey them thither, in order to obtain the best terms, while it supplied the less provident at their villages and bunting camps in quarters not frequented by American traders operating exclusively on their own resources. By these means, it is believed, a sufficient and proper supply of goods may be forthwith furnished all the Indian tribes on our borders, from sources independent entirely of foreign capital and foreign traders; and that, in the course of a few years, the public agencies may be withdrawn, and the whole trade laid open to individual enterprise, without injury to the political interests of the United States, or disregard to the condition of the Indians. In relation to the system of licensing private traders, I have no doubt that great abuses exist, and that alterations are requisite. In the first place, the penalties for trading with Indians without license are too light, and the forfeitures too easily evaded, to deter persons disposed to violate the law; and, in the next place, the Governors of Territories, and other agents authorized to issue licenses, are, as the existing provisions of the law on that subject have been construed, bound to give a license to any person whomsoever, foreigner or citizen, that can furnish security for $1,000. The result is, that our Indian countries are filled with persons hostile to the interests of the United States, and employed, in many instances, to excite animosities against our citizens and Government; or of desperate character, who are debasing the habits and destroying the health of the Indians, and at the same time cheating them of their little earnings, by constantly dealing out to them spirituous liquors. I beg leave to suggest, as a remedy for these evils, that it be provided by law that no license to trade with the Indians within our limits be issued to any person not a citizen of and resident within the United States; and that the entire power to issue these be lodged with the President, through such agents and under such restrictions as lie may from time to time direct. By this means the Executive will be at all times able so to regulate the private as well as the public trade as to insure from one or other of these sources a competent supply of goods in the different sections of Indian country. Anxious, sir, to make you, as requested, an early reply, I have hastily thrown together my ideas on the subject of your letter; they have not, however, been recently formed, and have been derived from some experience in Indian affairs. I shall be much gratified if they prove in the slightest degree useful to the Government. Very respectfully, I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant, J. MASON. To the Hon. WILLIAM II. CRAWFORD, Secretary of War. SIR:	JEFFERSONVILLE, IND. T., October 4, 1815. Your communication of the I7th August came to hand. One year’s annuities, which were for the year 1812, have been received by the then acting Governor, General Gibson, but none of them were disposed of as Government intended. General Gibson informs me that when General Hopkins reached Vincennes with his expedition against the Indians up the Wabash, he received an order from the general, which be conceived he was authorized to give, to deliver such articles out of the Indian annuities as might suit the militia under his command; that, agreeably to that order, all the blankets and other woollens were delivered, and he says an account kept, which account I have been endeavoring to procure to send on to your Department, but have not as yet been able to get it; this has been the cause of my delay in not acknowledging the receipt of your letter at an earlier period. Sundry of the goods have perished by damage in removing them from Vincennes to this place; what remained on hand when I took charge of the government of the Territory of Indiana amounted to about $800, and they a good deal damaged. 1 have given out of them at different periods, to friendly Indians, to the amount of $400; the balance are now on hand, but of such articles as are of trifling consideration. As soon as I can procure an account and statement of the gnods delivered to General Hopkins’s militia, I will forward it to your Department. As soon as the goods came into my hands, I wrote to the Secretary of War, and stated the situation of the goods, and suggested to him the propriety of making sale of them, but never received an answer. Accounts of all my transactions occasioned in expenditures with these Indians professing a friendly disposition have been transmitted to the Department of War. If any other statement than this should be thought necessary, please inform me. I am, with great respect, your obedient servant, TH. POSEY. P. S. The whole of the four years’ annuities are due the Indians. Hon. WILLIAM H. CRAWFORD, Secretary of War. SIR:	JEFFERSONVILLE, INDIANA TERRITORY, October 22, 1815. In my letter addressed to you of the 4th instant I mentioned having received of the Indian annuities, when I took charge of them, S800 worth; but, upon further investigation, I find the amount only to be $672 worth, $400 of which I made presents to the friendly Indians, leaving a balance of $272 agreeably to the charges in the original invoice, but the residue are so damaged and culled that they are worth very little. I have not received from General Gibson, neither has he been able to procure, an exact account of the goods from General W. Johnston, whom he intrusted tu deliver them to General Hopkins’s militia; he informs me that he will make a statement, as far as he is able, and send it on to the Department of War. I am, with great respect, your obedient servant, TH. POSEY. Hon. WILLIAM H. CRAWFORD, Secretary of War.	. SIR:	JEFFERSONVILLE, October 22, 1815. Governor Posey handed me a letter, together with some, resolutions of the Senate, from you directed to him, respecting Indian annuities. This was done by the Governor, I presume, because in the year 1812, after Governor Harrison left the Territory, its government fell under my direction, and, of course, the Indian annuities then on hand under my care. There were at that time at Vincennes annuities for the Kickapoos, Weas, and Piankeshaws, as per invoice, to the amount of $3,144 90. Having tio warehouse either public or private, I put them under the immediate care of General W. Johnston, in whom I then had confidence, and who acted as my private secretary. Some time in the same year I received a letter from the War Department, dated September 17, directing me to distribute the goods to the best advantage to the militia and volunteers then protecting the frontier. In obedience to that direction, I made distributions to a considerable amount, and directed an advance of twenty-five per cent, to be laid on the goods, to cover the expense of transportation, &c., and that duplicate receipts should be taken and forwarded to your Department. This I did, expecting the amount would be deducted from the pay of the militia and volunteers. The receipts were enclosed to Mr. Eustis, then Secretary of War, but I never received an acknowledgment of their safe arrival; I presume, however, they are now on file in your Department. Immediately on the perusal of your letter to Governor Posey, I wrote to Mr. Johnston for an account of the annuities, as well those delivered the militia and volunteers as those then in his hands. In answer to my letter, he enclosed me the within account, (marked No. 1,) by which it would appear that the goods are all regularly accounted for. I cannot, however, refrain from remarking that the sum of $397 87J is an improper one, inasmuch as that expense was defrayed out of a draft given the quartermaster, and which he has charged in his account; besides, the twenty-five per cent, adds to the amount charged to the different persons named in the account; that deducted will leave a considerable balance in the hands of Mr. Johnston, and for which he must be accountable. I am pretty well convinced that the account, when correctly and honestly stated, will stand as in the enclosed (marked No. 2;) and to that amount have I written to Mr. Johnston, urging on him, in as strong language as I could, the necessity of an immediate and correct settlement of the account, to which he has not as yet deigned to reply. Should I not receive an answer from him by to-morrow’s mail, I will transmit to your Department a copy of the several accounts forwarded to me by Mr. Johnston, together with the vouchers, for whatever were delivered the Indians by my direction. Yon will observe in the account furnished by Mr. Johnston (a copy of which is herewith enclosed) a charge to myself of $86 50; those goods I hold myself responsible for at any moment I am called on; they were mostly retained by me for some militia who were not otherwise able to supply their necessities. The above amount is charged with the twenty-five per cent, advance. Such was my situation as acting Governor of the Territory, that I was compelled to place confidence in some person; and all I have to regret is, that that confidence fell upon a man who shamefully abused it in almost every particular. I have the honor to be, with high consideration and respect, sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, The Hon. SECRETARY OP WAR. No. 1.

Your letter of the 2d instant is received, and you are authorized to dispose of any goods within your control destined for the Indian tribes who are now hostile, and distribute them to the best advantage among the volunteers and militia who are marching to the protection of the frontier, keeping an account of the same. SIR:	DETROIT, October 16, 1815. I have the honor to state that no presents were issued to the Indians in this Territory, except a few from the quartermaster’s department, the amount of which I have no means of ascertaining, between the period of my appointment, in 1813, and the month of August, 1814. In the months of August, September, October, November, and December, 1814, and January, 1815, goods to the amount of $11,312 61 were distributed io presents to the Indians at this place. But although these goods were distributed as presents, yet they were, io a considerable degree, rewards for services which had been rendered by the Indians. I am unable to state what presents’ were issued antecedent to the period above mentioned. The data for that purpose can only be found in the War Office. I transmit an abstract showing the annuities due to all the Indian tribes north of the Ohio, and east of the Mississippi. At what time any of these tribes received their last payment, I know not, nor have I any means of knowing. I have reason, however, to believe that those tribes whose annuities are payable at this place (namely, the Wyan- dots, Chippewas, Ottawas, and Pattawatamies) have received nothing since 1811; and that, consequently, four years’ annuities are due to them. I need not again say how necessary it is that these debts should be discharged. I transmit an abstract showing the amount due here, presuming that no payment has been made to them since 1811. Upon the subject of Indian affairs generally, I have nothing to add to the two letters I had the honor to forward to the War Department in July last in relation to them. Very respectfully, sir, I have the honor to be your most obedient servant, Hon. WM. H. CRAWFORD, Secretary of War. Names of tribes, Treaty of Greenville, Aug. 3, 1795. Vincennes, Aug. 13, 1803.

SIR:	' ST. LOUIS, October 1, 1815. By the last mail I had the honor of enclosing you a statement of annuities, presents due, paid, and delivered to the several Indian tribes under my superintendence, in conformity with a resolution of the Senate of the United States of the 4th of March, 1815. On the subject of the several questions presented in the last paragraph of the resolution, I beg leave to observe, there is not the smallest doubt in my mind but the present mode of managing our Indian relations ought to be materially altered. Those relations are every day growing more and more imperfect; and the decided policy of England (so recently and clearly developed) of using the Indian tribes to vex and harass our frontier settlements in time of peace, and as active partisans in time of war, ought to admonish the Government of the United States to adopt a more efficient system of regulating our Indian concerns than has heretofore been in use. In answer to the first question of the latter paragraph of the resolution, “ whether any alteration of the power and duties of the several officers and agents employed in the superintendence and management of Indian affairs would be advantageous!” experience has taught us that the Indian agents should be invested with more power, under the authority of the laws, to enable them to detect illicit trade; force from the Indian country improper characters; settle the disputes between the Indians and whites; prevent impositions, and enforce all the laws and regulations of Indian intercourse. It appears essential that the grade of Indian agency should be established in the different sections of country, from the general superintendent down to an interpreter. “ Whether the consolidation of the whole care and management of the Indian relations, and the placing the same in a single department, would be expedient!” On this point I fear I am incapable of giving you a satisfactory view. It would appear reasonable, however, to state that the great number of Indian tribes within the bounds of the United States, differing very materially in disposition, habits, manners, customs, and trade, would require much care and attention, with a correct knowledge of the Indians, to produce any thing like system in the management of them. And on a first view of the subject, it appears to me to be necessary to place all Indian concerns, both political and commercial, under the superintendence of a separate department; and, considering that trade is the great lever by which to direct the policy and conduct of the Indian tribes towards the United States, 1 have ever heen of opinion that the agents for trade stationed by the United States among the Indians ought also to be incorporated with the agents for political intercourse. The third question is one of the most difficult to answer; the habits, dispositions, <fcc. of the whites as well as the Indians differing so materially, as they do, in so vast a tract of country as the bounds of the United States. I have always been of opinion that some material changes were essentially necessary in the Indian trade. But to devise a plan by which that trade may be carried on with equal advantage to the Indian tribes, and more economical to the public, securing to the citizens the benefit of the Indian trade, without the exclusion of individuals, or giving to large companies a monopoly of Indian trade, is a subject which deserves more justice than I am able to bestow on it. I do not believe it would be expedient to hazard any material alteration for the present. The United States trading-houses, when well located and properly managed, are, beyond doubt, extremely useful; and, instead of being expensive, (I am told,) are profitable to the Government. There being at this time no public trading-houses in the Indian country in this Territory, I find, by the present mode ol small companies and individual traders, the tribes arc not at this time all furnished with what they absolutely require. An alteration in our present systennof intercourse of a commercial nature with the Indians, so as to compel all trade with Indians to be carried on at convenient established points, and placed under the eye of authority, may answer very well for the neighboring tribes, and those surrounded by our settlements, and would give facility in the humane policy of civilizing those tribes. This system, I fear, cannot be pursued with effect, for many years, with the numerous tribes of this Territory situated out of the settlements. But I am very much inclined to an opinion that a well-organized company, with a large capital, and a liberal aid and protection from the Government, might be made much more efficient in managing the Indian affairs well than the present plan. But it must be a company sufficiently powerful to take in hand all the trade of the Missouri and Upper Mississippi, to carry into complete effect one great and general system, in co-operation with, and partly under, the direction of the Government. Its capital ought to be large, (say 600,000 or 1,000,000 dollars,) and divided into small shares, (say 100 dollars each share, to enable the most indigent trader to become interested,) and could be subscribed, paid in, and managed very much in the manner usual among the commercial and banking companies throughout the United States. Perhaps it would be most expedient to confine at least three-fourths of the subscriptions to the western States and Territories, and it might probably be best to use a third or a fifth of the capital for banking purposes at St. Louis, (the most central, convenient, and commercial place.) A company thus powerful would be able Io furnish all the Indian tribes with the best of goods, and would, without doubt, sweep the whole of the valuable fur trade of the Missouri and Mississippi; expel all the petty (though now very powerful) British traders; and bring into our markets immense quantities of the most valuable furs and peltries. It would in a short time extend its influence and bear down all opposition among the most distant tribes. Its political influence should be purely American, directed in all respects, and at all places, with precisely the same policy, co-operating with the policy nf, and keeping up a regular correspondence with, the Government. The company should stipulate with Government (for equivalent advantages) to maintain regular trading-houses at such places as the United States have agreed to fix and maintain similar establishments. An establishment of this sort would interest a vast number of our western citizens in the well-managing of our Indian affairs; it would attract the attention of enterprising Americans, and give employment to the most of our citizens who are accustomed to trade with the Indians, and be the means of discovering and drawing forth for the use and comfort of our own country all the wealth with which this country abounds in furs, peltries, a variety of minerals, lead, salt, saltpetre, and also wool, tallow, and a great variety of valuable dying roots and drugs, heretofore only partially known. It would effectually draw out and keep out that restless and deadly hostile influence that has been heretofore used so successfully among the Indians to onr prejudice by the British traders and agents, and which is doubtless at this moment trying to fix itself firm enough to defy all our efforts to remove them, under the present system. A company such as I have been speaking of would be a combination of American capital and American traders to draw out foreign traders who are intruding without permission, and to place the Indian relations more under the control and management of the Government, and reap for themselves the profits of a trade immensely valuable. I will not take up your time in going more in detail on this subject. Small companies are found, from experience, to produce no valuable change, and are soon compelled to give up the Indian trade. It would be unsafe to abandon the present system of trading-houses until a general system and combination of private enterprise is organized. Our own traders, acting in violent opposition to each other, (as they very commonly do,) create nearly as much confusion and dissatisfaction among the Indians as foreign traders; and I have been under an impression that it was to counteract the fatal effects of such petty squabblers that Government first instituted public trading-houses. If they have not heen generally useful, is it not because, they are badly placed or badly managed? The system is unquestionably a good one, and, if its operations were less limited, it would be more efficient. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect, your most obedient, humble servant, Wil. CLARK. The Hon. WM. H. CRAWFORD, Secretary of War. Stu:	ST. LOUIS, October 10, 1815. Enclosed, herewith, I have taken the liberty of sending to yon some notes which I have procured from Colonel Auguste Chouteau and Mr. Thomas Forsyth, on the subject of Indian commerce, &e. Colonel Chouteau is a very correct man of observation, and has been in the habits of Indian intercourse for nearly fifty years, a part of which time the greater part of the Indian trade of this country was conducted by him. [See his notes following Governor Edwards’s letter of November, 1815, page 66.] Mr. Forsyth, at present an Indian agent for the Illinois river, has been long in the habits of trading with the Indians, and possesses a strong mind. I have the honor to be your most obedient, humble servant, The Hon. WM. H. CRAWFORD, Secretary of War. SIR:	ST. LOUIS, September 22, 1815. In consequence of a conversation that took place a few days ago between your excellency and myself about Indian affairs, I now take the liberty to give you my opinion as respects the method we ought to pursue towards the Indians to gain their good-will and friendship, by which means we may he able to procure that necessary influence over the different nations of Indians, wean them from foreign influence, and make the whole of them dependant on us; until which period we will always have the Indians as enemies when we are engaged in war with any of the European Powers. I have been often surprised on reflecting that we, as Americans, speaking the same language, having the same customs and manners, and having the same, means as the British, should have so little influence over the Indian nations; from which it would appear to me that there is a want of something somewhere. According to the present method of treating the Indians, it is, in my opinion, utterly impossible to gain their good-will, or have any influence with them. It cannot be expected that a Governor, who is also superintendent of Indian affairs, (who, perhaps, never saw an Indian before he came to the Territory he is to govern,) can know what course to pursue towards the Indians, or, indeed, what instructions to give to an agent. Indians are. always fond of novelty, and when they hear of the arrival of a Governor, they post off to visit their new father. The Governor, perhaps, not paying that attention to his visitants that they expected, the Indians return home much disappointed, saying that “their new father is a man of no sense, and did not offer them meat or drink, or any tobacco to smoke,” by which means the Indians become prejudiced against the Governor, and in the end this leads to something serious. You well know that those little civilities shown at times to Indians have had a good effect when affairs of consequence are to be settled between the whites and Indians. The British Government have brought their method of treating Indians to a perfect system; they have a well- regulated Indian department, with a store of goods and a blacksmith at every post for their use. No person is eligible for the place of agent unless he can speak some one of the Indian languages. It would be supposed that an agent thus appointed is acquainted with their customs and manners, as also with the different chiefs and headmen of the different nations of Indians. A British Indian agent will not think it derogatory to his rank to smoke and converse with an Indian chief or chiefs; by which means he cannot be imposed upon by designing interpreters, as sometimes happens with us. It is my decided opinion that our Government ought to establish a distinct department for Indians affairs in this country; a principal agent ought to reside at this place, with subagents at the different posts or garrisons, whose duty it should be to report to the principal agent only, and from him to the Government. Agents thus appointed, who know their duty, I would venture to say Indian affairs would go on properly. A department thus arranged, I would then recommend to treat the Indians well, and give them Indian law; to treat them well, I mean that a few presents be given to them every September, so that they might commence their fall hunt, with a little liquor every spring and autumn for a frolic. The sale of spirituous liquor by traders ought to be prohibited, as it is well known that Indians will sell any thing they have for liquor, when intoxicated. Listen to their complaints, and render them justice; never promise them more than you mean to perform; allow them a free trade to all places; and encourage as many traders as possible to engage in the Indian trade, so that the Indians may see that they are dependant on us; and keep them from travelling five or six hundred miles to visit a British post, where their minds are poisoned and prepared for any event that may be in agitation. To give them Indian law, I would only make this difference: give them so many days to deliver up the transgressor; and if they failed, then retaliate, and do not allow any traders to go into their country, and there can be no doubt but they will ask for peace, and take care that mischief will not again take place; or, if it did, they would not hesitate to deliver up the culprit. We see few or no American traders in any part of the Indian country; two reasons may be given for this: 1st. Indian goods brought on to this country are always sold high, and at a very short credit; by which means those who have the means purchase up the goods, and hire those who have not the means to purchase; to barter the goods in the Indian country, by which means a cargo of Indian goods that would employ two or three or more persons, if the credit were extended, fall into the hands of one purchaser, who employs only one person, or perhaps himself, to barterthe.se goods in the Indian country. 2d. It is impossible that any individual can purchase goods in this country and sell them as cheap as the factories. British traders only can oppose the factories, from the extensive credit they have, and the superior quality of their goods. There can be no other way of bringing the fur trade through its proper channels than by underselling the British traders. To shut them out totally would be making bad worse, as none of our traders or factors will credit the Indians so extensively as the British traders; and it would take such a vast quantity of woollens to supply all the Indians, that it appears that it would be many years befure every thing could be got in operation to content both parties. Another thing: without you can fully supply the Indians with goods for their furs, they would suppose that the shutting out of the British traders was intended to injure them, and not the whites. Any person conversant in Indian affairs must agree that a department judiciously organized, furnished with presents fur the Indians as above mentioned, having as an auxiliary here merchants who would furnish our traders with goods equal in quality and price to those brought from Canada, by which means our citizens would at least have a share in the Indian trade, would stop the baneful influence of foreign emissaries in the character of traders. A total dependance being on us for their supplies, the Indians would never again attempt to raise the tomahawk against the United States. I have the honor to be your excellency’s most obedient servant, T. FORSYTH. His Excellency Governor CLARK.—Present. SIR:	CHICKASAW AGENCY, Octnblr 24, 1815. In my attempt to fulfil the expectations of the honorable the Senate of the United States of the 2d of March, 1815, and your orders of the 17th of August last, I have thought proper to enclose for your information the letter and accounts of Mr. Isaac Rawlings, United States factor at the Chickasaw Bluffs, together with the best estimate I can make of the transactions that have taken place at the agency and its vicinity for the period embraced in the resolution. You will discover that the provision account during my agency far exceeds what was usual to be given; this was rendered indispensable, as well from the unusual number of Indians that attended, as for and on account of a guard I considered it my duty to select from the most confidential Indians and Indian country men, to guard the goods until I could give notice to the nation of the time of delivering. From this guard no other expense is incurred to the United States, and I hope you will easily see that the utmost economy was used, when you are informed that 2,654 Indians attended to receive the goods; and that, notwithstanding the best exertions I could possibly make, such is their slow and awkward manner of doing business, that it took me five days to make arrangements and complete the service. I cannot indulge myself in entertaining a hope that any information I can give, except of a local nature, will be useful to you; yet, as you have been pleased to request my opinion, you will not think it arrogant in me to give it, that it may receive the corrective hand of those that are better advised; and that, by exposing my want of knowledge, I may receive such admonition or advice as will enable me in future to keep clear of a repetition of errors. Among the most important objects that have occurred to my mind, and which I think should engage the attention of the General Government, as relative to the peace and happiness of this nation, is the enacting some prohibitory and penal laws, among which I think some salutary means should be provided to prevent the sale and too frequent use of ardent spirits among the Indians; that as frequent outrages are committed, as well by imprudent white men travelling through the Indian nation intoxicated, as by drunken Indians and others, some attention of the General Government might well be bestowed on that subject. Of the road leading from Colbert’s ferry to the Natchez, being the way by which many thousands trading to and from New Orleans, Mobile, &c., will pass and repass, and over which the public mail of the United States will have to travel, some repairs are indispensable through this nation; and I most respectfully suggest that a company of regular soldiers, in time of peace, would be well employed in making improvements on the road, and in removing and keeping intruders from off the Indian lands. A difficulty has arisen for which some remedy should be afforded: my predecessor, in the fall of 1813, ordered several parties of Indians into the service of the United States; his death, I presume, has been the cause why no proper representation has ever been made, or any pay given them for soch service; and although I am well assured that the service was faithfully performed, yet there are not such vouchers and orders in my possession as to enable me to render you a proper account of that service, and the Indians that performed that duty are quite uneasy on the subject of their pay. It is my opinion that it would be a great accommodation to the Indians if two or three more blacksmiths were allowed them, and a very considerable part of their annuity given in useful articles of husbandry, as many of them seem to incline to become farmers; and surely a schoolmaster would have a good effect among them, particularly as the half-breeds are very desirous to educate their children. Accept assurances of the high respect with which I have the honor to be your obedient servant, WILLIAM COCKE, Agent for U. S. to Chickasaws. The Hon. WILLIAM H. CRAWFORD, Secretary of War.

I was duly honored with your letter of the 17th of August, covering a resolution of the Senate of the United States, dated March 2, 1815, calling for information in relation to the trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes; in answer to which I have the honor to enclose as follows, viz: Paper marked A; account of annuities paid the Indians at Fort Wayne and Piqua for the four years antecedent to March 4, 1815. Paper marked B, containing an account of presents made to Indians at Fort Wayne and Piqua, under the agency of John Johnston, for four years antecedent to March 4, 1815. Paper marked C, showing the permanent annuities payable at Fort Wayne and Piqua, viz: Miamies, Eel Rivers, Pattawatamies, Shawanees, and Delawares. Paper marked D; Indian trade and trading-houses. Paper marked E; Indian agencies, &c. I have the honor to remain, with very great respect, sir, your most obedient servant, JNO. JOHNSTON, Indian Agent. The Hon. WILLIAM H. CRAWFORD, Secretary of War, Washington. A. Statement showing the annuities paid by John Johnston, Indian agent at Fort Wayne .and at Piqua, in Ohio, for the four years preceding the 4th March, 1815. $17,360 55 The Miamies, Eel Rivers, and Pattawatamies having joined the enemy, their annuities ceased to be paid after the year 1811. The Delawares and Shawanees remained faithful to the United States, and were paid regularly up to the commencement of the year 1815. I have no information from the War Department, as yet, of any annuities forthem the present year. The annuities due the before-mentioned tribes have always been punctually paid; and in every instance where damage or embezzlement has taken place in the transportation of the articles, the loss has been made good at the expense of he United States. JNO. JOHNSTON, Indian Agent. PIQUA, September 6, 1815. 11 E B. An account of presents made to Indians at Fort Wayne and at Piqua, under the agency of John Johnston, for four years antecedent' to the 4th of March, 1815. $31,597 11} It will be observed that the foregoing presents were chiefly made on account of the United States being at war, and that, in ordinary times, such disbursements are small. The Indians have no right, by treaty, compact, or agreement of any kind, to receive presents from the United States. It appears, however, to have been a custom, during every period of the American Government, and, I believe, all other Governments that have preceded it, with the Indians. The British load the Indians with presents, and thereby have imposed upon us the necessity of following their example, with this difference—that where we give one dollar, they at least give ten. JOHN JOHNSTON, Indian Agent. PIQUA, September 6, 1815. C. The Miamies, Eel Rivers, Delawares, Pattawatamies, and Shawanees are entitled to receive, by treaty, from the United States, in permanent annuities, as follows, viz: The Miamies, ------The Eel Rivers, ------That part of the Pattawatamies attached tu the Furt Wayne agency,	-	- The Delawares, ------The Shawanees, under the treaty of Greenville of 1795,	-	-	- - $2,300	00 - 1,100	00 - 1,500	00 - 1,500	00 - 1,000	00 $7,400 00 NOTE.—Under the treaty of Swan creek, or Fort Industry, of July, 1805, the Shawanees are entitled to a proportion of $1,000 per annum. During the years 1812, 1813, and 1814, I have paid them $500 per annum on account of this treaty, the other parties to it having joined the enemy. On account of the faithful adherence of the Shawanees to the United States during the late war, the Government should make this sum permanent to them, which would settle their annuity at $1,500 per annum. JOHN JOHNSTON, Indian Agent. PIQUA, September 6, 1815. D. TRADE WITH THE INDIANS. PIQUA, September 6, 1815. I have not materials for making out an account of the Indian trade, most of my papers having been lost or destroyed by the murder of my brother, and the burning of the public trading-house and establishment at Fort Wayne, in 1812; but there are ample materials for the purpose in the office of the superintendent of Indian trade. It may not be improper, however, to observe, that of all the trading-houses owned by the United States at the commencement of the late war, the one at Fort Wayne, of which I had the direction, yielded the most profit—about $10,000 was the clear gain; it commenced in 1802, and was destroyed in September, 1812. The trading-houses with the northern Indians never produced any political effect in our favor among them, but the contrary. The Indians were led to believe that the object was to make money; and inasmuch as the goods were never sold cheaper than those of the common traders, it was impossible to produce a contrary impression. Those sold at the public stores were generally of an inferior quality and fashion. I do not mean by this that the superintendent furnished bad goods; he procured the best that the market would afford; but such goods as are calculated for the Indian trade are rarely imported into the United States, there being nu regular demand for them. The British merchants in Canada have persons in England long used to this commerce, who send out the very articles wanted, and who never send any that are unsaleable. Under the superintendence of General Mason, the trading establishments have been as well conducted as any institutions of the kind could be, taking into view the difficulty of procuring regular assortments; but it is believed, for obvious reasons, that nothing of the kind carried on, on Government account, can be made to stand a successful competition with merchants, stimulated by private interest, so long established as those in Canada, and fortified and protected by all the power and patronage of the King’s Government. The supplies for the public trading-houses passing necessarily through many hands, great delays take place in the transportation, often arriving out of season, sometimes damaged, and sometimes embezzled. The furs and peltries, taking the same course to reach the market, often share the same fate; in one instance, I lost in Lake Erie $2,300 worth of furs and peltry through the carelessness of a drunken non-commissioned officer who had the command of the boats. The military have always been unfriendly to the trading-houses, and have invariably obstructed their successful operation. I know of no reason for this, except that they are instructed to furnish transportation, erect buildings, &c.; and this, not being connected with military operations, they do not consider as a part of their duty. I have long been of the opinion that, so far as concerns the northern Indians, the Government should leave the trade open to individual enterprise, and that they should by all means encourage their own citizens to embark in it, to exclude as far as possible, within their own limits, the subjects of Great Britain from any participation therein. Every British trader among the Indians is a political partisan, sowing the seeds of distrust and dislike against the Government and people of the United States. It was through this description of persons that all the plans of the late Indian war were laid, matured, and brought into operation. Associations of individuals, formed into a trading company on the plan of the British Northwest Company, would be more likely to insure a participation in the Indian trade than persons acting singly for themselves. In the commencement of the undertaking, losses might be expected; and this could be better met by a company. There can be no question but the trade, in the end, would be profitable. Immense fortunes have been made by it in Canada; and although it is not nuw so profitable as formerly, it would still be an object worthy the attention of the American merchant. It must be a cause of regret with all, that the subjects of a foreign nation should continue to monopolize a lucrative trade within the territories of the United States, and that, too, without the Government deriving any revenue from it; for it is notorious that the greater part of the goods taken into the Indian country by British traders are smuggled. The avowed object in retaining possession of Mackinac so long was to afford an opportunity this season of passing an immense quantity of Indian goods upwards, as well for trade as to supply the Indians on the Upper Mississippi with the means of carrying on the war against the whites. The refusal of the Indians to treat shows plainly the agency of the ever-active vindictive enemy of these States. I have no hesitation in declaring that the views of the Government will be better promoted, in relation to the management of the northern Indians, by leaving the trade open to the enterprise of American citizens, and that such laws and regulations may be enacted as will encourage and protect them, to the exclusion of foreigners, in the prosecution of it. Should Government, however, determine on renewing the trading-houses, I am decidedly of the opinion that a person actually experienced in the Indian trade should be kept in England, as an agent, for the purpose of selecting and procuring supplies for the trade and the annuities. All which I have the honor to submit to the honorable the Secretary of War., JOHN JOHNSTON, Indian Agent. E. INDIAN AGENCIES, &c. PIQUA, September 6, 1815. No inconvenience or injury that I know of has ever arisen to the public service in consequence of the Secretary of War having the management of Indian affairs, nor do I know what necessity there is for placing the direction and superintendence thereof in a separate department. But there is much room for reform in the details of the plan fordoing business with the Indians; the present mode is expensive, and experience has shown is productive of very little service: if proper attention had been bestowed on this subject, it is more than probable hostilities with the natives might have been avoided. In order to watch the Indians, and the traders who infest their country, the public agents should be multiplied among them; every tribe should have an agent who should be compelled to reside with them, or so near as to be able to have an eye to them at all times, and should be held accountable for the peaceable conduet of the Indians committed to his charge, or at least so far as to detect and make known any mischievous designs which they may have formed, in time that the execution thereof might be prevented; and this it is conceived would be in the power of any agent who paid attention to his duty. Agents might as well, for any good they do to the public service, reside at Washington City, as at Detroit, St. Louis, Kaskaskia, or Vincennes. Each tribe having an agent, a certain numher of agencies should be committed to the superintendence of one person—either the Territorial Governors, or any other the President might appoint. There are some objections to the Governors of Territores being ex officio superintendents of Indian affairs; some of them think the subject beneath their notice, and pay little or no attention to it; some are, of course, whatever their other qualities may be, not calculated for the purpose; the business is left to others, and in this way the service suffers. Where the Governors will bestow proper attention on the subject, they should be preferred, because their residence necessarily being near the Indian country, communications can be frequent between them and the agents. A capable, upright man, who would beget the confidence of the. Indians, by application, integrity, and a scrupulous regard for truth, should be preferred to all others. Under the present plan, there is a horde of persons called interpreters and subagents in employ, who do no good, for they are generally permitted to reside at the seats of the Territorial Governments, where there is little or no occasion for them; it is among the Indians that such persons, to do service, must be stationed. Should an agent be appointed to each tribe, he would want but one interpreter, of course. It may be alleged that agents, to reside with the Indians, would be exposed to much personal danger. I do not believe this would be the case. The chiefs of the Indians would feel a pride in having the.representative of the Government among them, and would, after a proper acquaintance, afford him all the aid and protection in their power; but if the Indian country be garrisoned, in most of cases it would suit the agents to reside near some fort. In the present unsettled state of the Indians, peace cannot be preserved, and the public authority maintained, without a respectable military force judiciously posted near their most populous settlements. There is nothing that the Indians so much dread as having garrisons in their country; and inasmuch as the means of influencing them still remain with the British, and, by the by, in a greater degree than ever, in consequence of their making common cause in the late war, it behooves the United States now to take effectual measures against any future rising of the Indians, and it is conceived this can only be done by garrisoning their country, and placing watchful sentinels over them in the character of agents. The places to be garrisoned I conceive to be Chicago; the old Peoria towns, on the Illinois river; Green Bay, somewhere near the mouth of Fox river; at the old Wea towns, on the Wabash river; Fort Harrison atid Fort Wayne to be kept up; suitable positions on the Mississippi and Missouri to be garrisoned; some intermediate points between the Mississippi and Lake Michigan to be occupied and garrisoned; also, after these forts are completed, one hundred men at each will be sufficient; at some of them fifty would answer. To man the whole of the new garrisons that may be necessary among the northern Indians, one thousand men will be amply sufficient. The expense of supporting such a force is not to be placed in competition with the chances of an Indian war, which would be at least ten to one against us, in leaving the Indian country as it now is. In reviewing this subject, it may be profitable to recur to the period of the commencement of the late war, when the Indian country, in the almost total absence of the United States authorities, fell an easy prey into the hands of the enemy. Forts, situated in places not accessible to vessels that navigate the lakes, should be provisioned for a year. The supplies'of goods and other necessaries for the Indians should be forwarded to the agent of each tribe, so that they might reach him by the beginning of September, in every year. This is a short time before the Indians commence their hunting excursions for the winter; should they arrive much later, they could not receive them before the ensuing year. It is of much consequence the keeping of large numbers of Indians from being collected together; the breaking them up into separate agencies will have this effect; when a number of tribes get together, they become too sensible of their own strength and importance. The northern Indians scarcely ever meet in large numbers without plotting mischief against us. There have been too many treaties made with the northern Indians; and when they have been broken on their part, no punishment has followed; this I take to be the grand cause of their present hostile temper. I have always thought it a questionable policy to press the Indians for such repeated cessions of their country; it has soured their minds against us, and has furnished the British with the best arguments in seducing the Indians from their duty and allegiance to the United States. In many instances, purchases have been made of their lands in places not required by the wants of our population. At a treaty held at Fort Wayne, in 1809, a large tract of land was procured on the Wabash, and a small strip fifteen miles wide on the west side of the old boundary, extending to Fort Recovery. The Indians, on the first application, consented to let us have the fifteen miles wide, because, they said, our people were crowded, and wanted more1 room; but they could not see what we wanted with the tract on the Wabash, where we had no people to occupy it, unless it were to get rid of the Indians who lived on it. These were the remarks of the Miami chief, (the Little Turtle,) made to myself. The Government may rest assured that the whole of the Indian lands will fall into our hands soon enough to answer the demands of our surplus population; for when the land becomes useless to them, as no longer affording game for their subsistence, they will offer it for sale to the United States, and move back; and, seeing that all former experience proves this fact, I can see no use in distressing the natives, and making our Government and people odious to them, by pressing them for premature sales of their country. In another point of view, it is conceived to be a dnubtful policy having several districts of country bordering on the Indians for sale at the same time; the consequence is, that the settlements become scattered and irregular, generally following the watercourses, thereby presenting innumerable fronts, and, in the event of war, subjecting the Government to incalculable expense in protecting them; indeed, no force can be adequate to such a purpose. On the contrary, if the settlements be made compact, they will contain within themselves a force sufficient for all the purposes of defence against savages. Each Indian agency should be furnished with several national flags handsomely ornamented. All which is respectfully submitted to the honorable the Secretary of War. JOHN JOHNSTON, Indian Agent. SIR:	INDIAN AGENCY OFFICE, FORT WAYNE, October 1, 1815. I have been just honored, by your letter of the 17th of August, with several copies of the resolution of the Senate of the 2d of March, and requiring of me statements and observations relating to the Indian department; and 1 hasten to lay before you the information required. The Delawares, Pattawatamies, and Miamies have been considered as the proper charge of this agency. But temporarily, the Wyandots, with some Senecas, Kanzas, Delawares, and Shawanees, whoreside with the Wyandots, were put under my charge during the war, and still remain so. The annuities of those tribes are: to the Wyandots, by the treaty of Greenville of 1795, $1,000 in goods; by the treaty of Detroit, $400 in cash; to the Wyandots, and those Indians who reside with the Wyandots, by virtue of the treaty of Swan creek, $1,000 in cash; the whole annuity to the Delawares is $1,800 in goods; the Pattawataniiesireceive from this agency $1,000 in goods, (their whole annuity is $2,400:) the Miamies, $2,300; and the Eel Rivers, $1,100 in goods. There was an annuity of $500 to the Miamies and Eel Rivers, that ceased to be payable after the year 1813. I was not in office in 1811; nor is there any record left in this office that will show the precise time of the delivery of the annuities for that year. But 1 can state that al) the Indians under my charge acknowledged the receipt of their respective annuities for the year 1811. For 1812, there were forwarded, in goods, for the Delawares, $1,800; Eel Rivers, $1,100; Miamies, $2,800; Pattawatamies, $1,000. All the goods for the Detroit agency were forwarded to Cincinnati, and there lodged subject to my order. I ordered them to be delivered to the care of John Johnston, Indian agent, to be transported to Piqua, there to wait my further orders; the disposition of the Indians at that moment appearing doubtful. In the mean time, a general council had been directed at Piqua, and special commissioners appointed. All doubts having been removed with respect to the hostility of a great part of those Indians, and no security for the friendship of any, the commissioners advised Mr. Johnston to have the remaining goods (a small part of which had been given out at the council) transported back to Dayton, as a'place of greater security. There they remained in charge of Mr. Johnston, and he informed me that he had reported the same to the War Department. I can, however, state, from undoubted authority, that a detachment of militia of Kentucky, in marching through Dayton to the relief of this fort when besieged, opened the stores containing the Indian goods, and took such articles as they chose, without rendering any account; the exact amount I cannot determine. Mr. Johnston has, no doubt, rendered an account. From illness, I was not able to attend the general council at Piqua, and Mr. Johnston delivered out of the goods above mentioned the annuity to the Delawares and Shawanees, and $610 in goods to the Wyandots. When, from the hostile appearance of the Indians in the neighborhood of this post, in August, 1812, it was thought advisable by the clerk of the store of goods for Indian trade to move the goods into the fort, all were moved in except a few heavy articles, such as iron and steel, in bars, and some other iron articles, and the skins that had been taken of the Indians in barter: the amount of the skins I am not able to determine—1 should think about $4,000. The clerk of the store being killed by the Indians, and the factor (John Johnston) being at his residence at Piqua, I took charge of the goods. General Harrison, arriving with an army to the relief of this post, ordered me, as Governor of the Indiana Territory, to deliver over to the commanding officers of regiments all such goods as were suited to the necessities of the army; which was done, and an account rendered to John Johnston, factor.	' > During the siege of this place, all the buildings belonging to the Indian department and the department of Indian trade were necessarily burnt for the safety of the fort. There are no records left in this office of the expense of those buildings, nor to which department the expense was charged; but I should think it would be about $2,000. About the close of 1812, by order of General Harrison, I removed my office to Upper Sandusky; and, in 1813, 1 accompanied the army under his command into Upper Canada, in command of the Indians, and by his order acted temporarily as agent at Detroit. During this year I made considerable expenditures for provisions for the Indian department, and to a small amount in presents in fitting nut the Indian warriors, and some few other presents: an exact account of all which has been rendered to the War Department. In July, 1814, a treaty with those tribes was ordered to be held at Greenville, and $20,000 worth of goods was ordered to be provided for that purpose. John Johnston was ordered to take an inventory of the goods abovementioned remaining on hand at this post and at Dayton, and purchase at Cincinnati a sufficient quantity to make up that amount; and I believe about $24,000 amount was furnished Mr. Johnston, who will render the account of the amount purchased and on hand. We acted jointly at that treaty in the management of the pecuniary affairs, under the general direction of the commissioners; but the accounts remain with Mr. Johnston, who will transmit them to the War Department. Out of those goods the Delawares were paid all the annuity which was due to them up to that date. The Wyandots received $390, the balance due to them in goods of their annuity of 1812, and the goods, part of their annuity for 1813 and 1814. I offered them goods in lieu of the cash, but they refused to receive them, (those nations being considered as not having forfeited their claims to their annuities.) There was, therefore, remaining due to the Wyandots, and those Indians residing with the Wyandots at that time, $4,200 in cash, which was reported to the War Department by the commissioners. From the pressing urgency of the Indians, and the manifest public injury from longer delay of payment, I drew on the. Secretary of War the 6th February, 1815, for that amount, and have received no advice whether honored or not. In February last, I purchased in Cincinnati goods to the amount of $1,398 63f, which have been given in very small presents to Indians, in the ordinary cases of the Indian department as they have daily occurred from that time to this, with a small remainder of $50 value. It appears from the foregoing history of the pecuniary transactions of the Indian department, so far as my knowledge extends, that there fell due to the Indians at present under charge of this agency, and who adhered to the United States during the four years immediately	preceding	the 2d	of	March, 1815— To the Wyandots, in goods, -	-	-	-	$4,000 To the Wyandots, in cash, -	-	-	-	1,600 To the Wyandots, and those Indians who	live	with	them, in	cash,	-	4,000 $9,600 Delawares, ------	7,600 17,200 To those tribes who were hostile, and embraced by the treaty of Greenville, of 1815— Pattawatamies,	-----	$4,000 Miamies,	-----	10,000 Eel Rivers,	-----	4,400 Miamies and Eel Rivers, for 1812 and 1813,	-	-	1,000 19,400 $36,600 If this latter sum of $19,400 to the Pattawatamies, Miamies, and Eel Rivers is considered as forfeited by their hostility, (except the annuity paid in 1811,) there remains due only for the four years— To the Wyandots, and those who reside with the Wyandots, $4,200. The whole amount of presents does not appear from the above account, because many presents were given by military officers out of supplies intended for the military department, and, in some few cases, reported to the agents. But I believe the whole amount (exclusive of the treaty of Greenville and provisions) has been about $4,300. The amount of provisions given is still more difficult to determine, for the same reason; yet I think it may be estimated to have amounted in the four vears, within the limits where at different times I have had charge, to about $230,000. With respect to the question presented in the last paragraph of the resolutiqp of the Senate, I must observe that I have during the late war had some opportunities of observing the difference in the organization between the British Indian department of the Canadas and that of the United States, and am clearly of the opinion that the British organization is, in several particulars, superior to that of the United States. The British give to all the. officers of their Indian department a military brevet rank, and cause them to wear military insignia. And they give employment to every white man whom they believe to have any influence among Indians; and if he renders no service, they say it is worth more than he costs to keep him from doing them an injury; that the Government has no other concern in Indian trade than to regulate it. The relative rank their officers acquire with their military rank has many very evident advantages, particularly in accelerating and rendering uniform all their measures; and the military rank adds greatly to their importance in the view of the Indians. It obviates, in some measure, what the United States have experienced much embarrassment from, viz: the powers of an Indian agent in the neighborhood of a military post, in relation to the officer commanding not being clearly defined. It has been my belief that there would be an advantage resulting from all Indian agents having military powers similar to the Governors of Territories, but of subordinate rank. The experience of the late war has shown that we cannot have a British war without a war with the Indians, and that the only means of preventing their joining the enemy is, to give them immediate employment with our armies. In this case, it would be highly important that the officers of the Indian department who are individually acquainted with the Indians under their charge, respectively, should conduct them in the field. If so, military rank would be almost indispensable to the officers of the Indian department. I have been fully satisfied that the advantages contemplated, resulting from the Indian trade carried on by the Government, have not been realized; that the Indians of the northwest have an aversion to it, from a belief that it is not carried on 'for their benefit, but as a matter of speculation. The enemies of the United States have persuaded many Indians to believe that it was a scheme of the United States to permit them to take the goods on credit until they should not be able to make payment, and then take their lands from them to satisfy the debt. I believe that the Indian trade may be put under such restraints by the Government, in the hands of companies or individuals, that it may be managed with as much regularity as in the hands of the Government. I am of the opinion that the oath of allegiance should be required of all Indian traders, and that the moral character and characteristic attachment to the United Slates should be a matter of considération; that there should be a power vested in the agents of the United Slates to inspect the trade and punish frauds. I have no donut that during the late war the affairs of the Indian department have languished for want of the necessary attention of the head of the War Department, (which no doubt was unavoidable.) And if putting the Indian department under a separate head can be considered consistent with its receiving military, added to its civil powers, I should be clearly of the opinion that it shoold be a separate department. In a state of peace, the present organization might answer every purpose. But to be prepared for a state of war must be our highest interest; and the present powers and organization appear not to be sufficiently efficient for that state. It has been the result of my observation that the attempt to civilize Indians, while they have a widely extended forest to ramble in, will prove abortive; but that their ferocity may be neutralized by supplying their wants, and they attached to the source from whence they receive this supply; that the British have gained great advantages over us by their great liberality to the Indians; and that it has cost the United States more treasure in the late war (exclusive of blood) in opposing Indians purchased by British liberality, than would secure them to the United States for thirty years. I think we should increase our liberality to a degree at least equal to that of the British, or not give them any thing. What we give and pay them, when compared with the presents they receive from the British, appears so trifling, that to withhold all presents would not have much, if any, more injurious effect than giving them so moch less; that it is much cheaper reducing them by meat and bread than by the force of arms; and, from the observations I have had the opportunity of making, that three or four months’ full feeding on meat and bread, even without ardent spirit, will bring on disease, and, in six or eight months, great mortality. And would it be considered a proper mode of warfare? I believe more Indians might be killed with the expense of §100,000 in this way, than $1,000,000 expended in the support of armies to go against them. I have the honor to be, sir, your very obedient servant, B. F. STICKNEY, Indian Agent. Hon. WM. FI. CRAWFORD, Secretary of War. Sin:	CHEROKEE AGENCY, November 30, 1815. I have had the honor of receiving your letter of the 17th August last, accompanied by a resolution of the Senate of the 2d March last, requiring a report on the several questions therein stated. I proceed to report first— Of Annuities.—It is understood that annuities become due in this agency at the commencement of each year, but are not expected to be received by the Indians until the Government shall direct the payment. On the 13th of July, 1812, I paid the Cherokee annuity for that year, and transmitted a receipt therefor, -------	$9,000 00 On the 1st of November instant, I paid the Cherokee annuities for the years 1813, 1814, 1815, 1816, and a balance over that will apply in part payment of their annuity for the year 1817; the amount of the four years’ annuity, at $9,000 per year, -	-	-	36,000 00 The balance over, to be deducted from their annuity for the year 1817, is -	-	3,744 33i Total amount of annuities paid in this agency within the times specified in the resolution of the Senate, -------	$48,744 33 i Presents.—Presents, within the periods required by the resolution of the Senate, made to the Cherokees for the promotion of agriculture and domestic manufactures, in prosecution of the plan of Government to lead them from a state of hunters to that of herdsmen and cultivators, and a knowledge of the useful arts, amount to -	-	-	-	-	$8,445 8C Presents to Cherokee officers of distinguished merit, who served under the command of General A. Jackson, in the Creek war, -----	956 29i Total amount of presents to the Cherokees within the times specified in the resolution of the Senate, -------	$9,402 09 j I now proceed to make such observations on the several parts of the last paragraph of the resolution of the Senate as may appear to me to be just. The first question is, “ Whether any alteration of the powers and duties of the several officers and agents employed in the superintendence and management of Indian affairs would be advantageous?” On this question, I beg leave to observe that, if the Indian trade, as hitherto carried on, shall not have supported the appropriations that have been made for that department, it would seem that a remedy should be applied—that is, to empower the principal officer of the Indian department (if not already authorized) to direct the several factors in his department to put such advance on the merchandise for that trade as, after a careful estimation of all the expenses, would secure the United States from loss, and moderately increase the capital. This ought to be done to guard against adventitious circumstances, which may be expected to happen, particularly from the double transportation of the merchandise and the articles received in payment at the trading-houses. A good mercantile advance being put on the goods will not frustrate the benevolent design of the first institution of that trade; for the Indians will still be furnished with goods at the factories from fifty to one hundred and fifty per centum cheaper than they now pay to itinerant and straggling traders, who, under licenses, traverse the whole Indian countries within the United States; they meet the Indians at their hunting camps, and purchase the finest articles from them; so that the articles brought to the public stores are often of an inferior quality. This is an additional reason why a reasonable mercantile advance should be put on the merchandise at the public stores. It is my opinion, from foor- teen years’ observation here, that there is no benevolence in selling any thing to the Indians at such reduced prices as thereby to reduce the capital; it has the effect to lessen his industry; it cherishes his strongest passion—the love of ease; he rarely exerts his powers but from necessity. The next part of the last paragraph of the resolution of the Senate is, “ Whether the consolidation of the whole care and management thereof, and the placing the same in a single department, would be expedient?” To this question I answer in the affirmative. I have a long time been of this opinion, and have frequently expressed it. I will endeavor to give some reasons for that opinion; and here I must be indulged with a long detail of some very perplexing business which, through the Indian agencies, at present appertains to the War Department. All the burglaries, thefts, stealing horses and other property, some robberies, personal abuses, and injuries of almost every description on the frontiers—all these are as common to one party as the other, and are brought to the agent as complaints demanding redress; these complaints are in general badly stated, having no legal testimony to substantiate them. On the part of the Indians, they are still more defective for want of testimony, because, by our institutions, (hey are prohibited the privilege of making oath. There are hundreds of these cases, and many of them are undoubtedly just, that cannot be supported by legal evidence. They are taken up by the agent and de- cided on by self-created extra-judicial procedure. The agent calls to his aid one or two judicious men. We then style ourselves a board. We take up each case, examine the documents, (where there are any adduced,) and hear verbal testimony—altogether so on the part of the Indians; their simple narration must be attended to. After which the board gives an opinion on each case; they are then transmitted by the agent with the documents, with our remarks, to the Secretary of War, where they are re-examined, and returned to the agent confirmed or negatived by the Secretary. The successful claimant is paid his damages recovered; as to the other, there is an end of the process. This extra-judicial procedure is believed to be the only mode that can be adopted at present to do justice to these complaints, for scarcely any one of these cases could be sustained in a court of law. Some of these cases require as much time for investigation as a trial in a court of law; and though the amount of damages is generally of inconsiderable value, yet they are of moment to the poor claimants, and must be adjusted in some way to prevent the parties from making reprisals which would lead to hostilities. I have by this detail endeavored to show the extent of this perplexing business appertaining to the duties of the War Department under the present arrangement. It is my opinion that all the business of Indian trade, and the business of the Indian agencies, particularly such as I have just stated, ought to be transacted in another department—I mean an Indian department. It appears to me that there should be no law litigation, no chancery jurisdiction, and no counting-house rooms in the War Office. The mind of the War Department should be exclusively occupied about war and preparation for war; if in case of war there should be Indian corps organized, they, of course, become a part of the army, and will not while in service be considered as belonging to the Indian department, but under the War Department. Every thing extraneous to this highly responsible department it appears to me should be removed. We talk about peace: let us make the best use of it; from my observation, the eyes of the community continue to be yet fixed on the War and Navy Departments. The question in the last part of the resolution of the Senate is, “ Whether a plan may not be devised that will be equally advantageous to the Indian tribes, and more economical to the puhlic, whereby the Indian trade may, under safeguards, be hereafter carried on by individuals or by private companies, instead of the manner in which the same is now conducted?” On this part of the resolution of the Senate I beg leave to observe that I cannot conceive it practicable, by any guards in the power of Government, to restrain individuals or private trading companies from taking advantages of the Indians, and such a measure might be viewed by the Indians as a relinquishment of the original plan of the institution of that trade. It appears to me that by factors under the control of Government the trade may be carried on without loss to the United States. I have always understood that benevolence and policy were combined in the plan of this trade, and it is undoubtedly true that the Indians consider the public trading-houses as their fathers’ houses; they are rallying points where the Indians feel at home; they feel the paternal care of the Government; it strengthens their attachment and fidelity. I can make no other report on the subject of Indian trade on public account than that it was discontinued here in 1811.	.	.. In your letter you gave me a latitude in making observations, which I must plead as an apology for the length of my letter.	, I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant, RETURN J. MEIGS. Hon. WILLIAM H. CRAWFORD, Secretary of War. SIR:	CHOCTAW AGENCY, October 25, 1815. I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 17th August last, enclosing a resolution of the Senate of the United States. The short time I have been agent, and the little of that time 1 had to spare from more pressing duties arising from the late war, have not afforded me leisure or opportunity to be well informed on the subjects embraced in the resolution. I requested my predecessor, Mr. Dinsmoor, to favor me with the result uf his observations and experience; a copy of his note I have the honor to enclose. With a vigorous mind and solid judgment, 1 know no person in the Indian department that has done so much towards civilizing the Indians, and I feel confident his information and suggestions will have due weight. During my agency I have delivered to the Choctaws $4,831 88 in goods, part of their annuity for the year 1813, leaving a balance, by report from the Indian office, December 15, 1813, of $1,028 12, and there is now in store here $5,851 for the annuity of 1814. I am informed by Mr. Hawkinson’s agent at Natchez that a quantity of goods has been received by him subject to my order, (by the invoice accompanying them, $19,001 13},) but I have not yet received the invoice, or any official information to govern me in their distribution. I understand the invoice and instructions are at Natchez. I have prepared the Indians to receive, in advance, for their annuity, such part as may have been directed by General Jackson for that purpose, and I expect to have them brought up and distributed in all this month. 1 have the honor to be, with very great respect, sir, your obedient servant, JOHN McKEE. The Hon. WILLIAM II. CRAWFORD, Secretary of War. The agent has the disposal of the following articles, cash and merchandise, for the Choctaws, viz: Sundry goods, the balance undamaged, of an invoice forwarded by	General	Jackson,	$18,783	88} Annuity for 1814, including mingoes’ salary and stand rent,	-	-	5,851	00 Balance in cash due the chiefs and nation for the year 1813,	-	-	1,028	12 $25,663 00} The agent delivers the annuity for 1814, as per invoice, -	-	-	$5,851 00 The balance in cash for the annuity of 1813 he delivers to the three great meda] chiefs, for their salary for the years 1813, 1815, and part of 1816,	-	1,028	12 He will	deliver	to the mingoes, as the balance of their salary for 1816,	-	321	88	- He will deliver to the mingoes, in goods, their salary for 1817,	-	-	450 00 He will	deliver	annuities, including stand rent, for 1815, 1816, and 1817,	-	16,200	00 He will	deliver	as presents to the mingoes, leaders, and distinguished warriors,	-	1,812	00} CHOCTAW AGENCY, December 29, 1815. I certify that in November last, at the request of Colonel John McKee, United States agent to the Choctaw nation of Indians, I inspected sundry packages of merchandise received for the nation, found some of the bales entirely broken up, the goods much damaged, some of the cloths absolutely rotten, and most of them injured except some packed in sound tierces. SILAS DINSMOOR. SIR:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, August 17, 1815. The enclosed resolution of the Senate clearly defines the nature of the information which you are requested to give this Department relative to the amount of annuities and presents due, paid, and delivered to the several Indian tribes within your agency, during the four years immediately preceding the 4th of March, 1815. In directing your attention particularly to the clause respecting annuities and presents, it is not intended to confine your communications to those points. In the discharge of your official duties, you have no doubt acquired an intimate knowledge of the general nature of the subject embraced in the resolution. Your views and observations upon the several questions presented in the last paragraph will be received with great pleasure, and will meet with all the consideration which the importance of the subject requires. My recent assumption of the duties of this Department, and.the near approach of the period when the duty required by the resolution must be performed, make it necessary that the information which it is in your power to give should be transmitted with the least possible delay. With great respect, I have the honor to be your most obedient servant, WM. H. CRAWFORD. [Addressed to the Governors of the Mississippi, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Missouri Territories; William Cocke, Chickasaw Agent; Erastus Granger, Indian Agent, Buffalo; Major Samuel Lovely, Indian Agent, Arkansas; John Johnston, Indian Agent, Piqua; Benjamin F.
