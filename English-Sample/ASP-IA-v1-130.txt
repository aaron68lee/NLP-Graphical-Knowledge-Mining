Mr. Anderson, from the committee appointed to inquire w hether any, and, if any, what, alterations are necessary to be made in the act for establishing trading houses with the Indian tribes, and the several acts supplementary thereto, reported the following letters for publication: Committee Chamber, id April, 1810. Sir: 1 am directed by the committee to whom lias been referred a resolution of Senate to inquire whether any, if any, what, alterations are necessary to be made, in the act establishing trading houses with the Indian tribes, and the several acts supplementary thereto, to ask information of you upon the follow ing points: What number of trading houses have been established, under the act for establishing trading houses with the Indian tribes? At what places have the trading houses been established? What number of agents have been employed, and what compensation has been annually allowed them respectively? If the annual compensation allowed them, exceeds ten thousand dollars, at what time did that excess commence, and by what authority was that excess directed to be expended? bat was the state of the trading fund, at the latest date that accounts have been rendered? Has the capital stock been diminished, and, if it has, what is the amount of the diminution? Accept the assurance of my high respect. JUS. ANDERSON, Chairman of the Committee. J. Mason, Esq. <£*c. Indian* Trade Office, 12/A Jlpril, 1810. Sir: In reply to the several inquiries made by the letter you did me the honor to address me on the 3d instant, I have to state that, since the commencement of the system, fourteen trading houses with the Indian tribes have been established, at the periods and in the positions enumerated below: At Coleraine, on the river St. Mary’s, in the State of Georgia, in the year 1795. At Tellico block house, in the Southwestern territory, in the year 1795. At fort St. Stephens, on the Mobile, in the Mississippi territory, in the year 1802. At Chickasaw bluffs, on the Mississippi, in the Mississippi territory, in the year 1802, At fort Wayne, on the Miami of the Lakes, in the Indiana territory, in the year 1802. At Detroit, in the Michigan territory, in the year 1802. At Arkansas, on the river Arkansas, in the territory of Louisiana, in the year 1805. At Natchitoches, on the Red river, in the territory of Orleans, in the year 1805. At Relic Fontaine, mouth of the Missouri, in the territory of Louisiana, in the year 1805. At Chicago, on Lake Michigan, in the Indiana territory, in the year 1805. At Sandusky, Cake Erie, in the State of Ohio, in the year 1806. At the Island of Michilimackinac, Lake Huron, in the Michigan territory, in the year 1803. At fort Osage, on the Missouri, territory of Louisiana, in the year 1808. At fort Madison, on the Upper Mississippi, territory of Louisiana, in 1808. Of these, two have been discontinued, that at Detroit, in 1805. and that at Belle Fontaine, in 1808; and two have been removed, that established originally at Coleraine, on the St. Mary’s, to fort Wilkinson, on the Oconee, in 1797: and again, from that place to fort Hawkins, on the Oakmulgee, in 1806: and that originally established at Tellico, to the Hiwasee of the Tennessee, in 1807. There are now in operation twelve trading houses, viz. at fort Hawkins, at Hiwasee, at fort St Stephen’s, at Chickasaw bluffs, at fort Wayne, at Arkansas, at Natchitoches, at Chicago, at Sandusky, at Michilimackinac, at fort Osage, and at fort Madison. There have been employed, in all cases, a principal agent at each house, and in most cases, an assistant agent or clerk at each. The compensation allowed has been from $750_to $1250, per annum, to the principal agents, and from $250 to §600, per annum, to the assistant agents or clerks, exclusive of rations or alloivance for rations, paid out of the funds of this establishment It does not appear that the annual compensation allowed to agents and assistant agents, or clerks, exceeded the sum of ten thousand dollars, until the year 1805; previous to which time, as has been said, six trading houses had been established; during that year four additional houses were set up, and one discontinued, leaving then in operation nine houses. At this time, the allowance of rations was commuted into money, at fixed rates per annum, and the compensations paid during the latter part of this year (1805) stood thus: 8 agents, at $1,000, per annum,.......................................................    $3,000 1 agent, at - -- -- -- -.........................................1,250 7 assistants, at $500, - -- -- -- -.............................. 3,500 1 assistant, at    400 $13,150 Allowance for subsistence, in lieu of rations: 9 agents, at §365 per annum, - - - - -..........................................$3,285 6 assistants, at §150   - 900 l assistant, at...............................- - - - - -- -- iso $4,365 This commutation for rations, and these rates and amounts of compensation, were directed to be paid by order of the Secretary of War. The allowance to agents and their assistants or clerks, has heeti increased from that time, as additional trading houses have been set up, and there are payable, for the current year, to the persons, and at the posts, named in the paper marked A, sent herewith, and as there shown in detail: For salaries..........................................................$14,750 For subsistence - -- -- -- -- 5,475 Together $20,225 For the further information of the honorable committee, I beg leave to annex copies of three communications, made by me, as to these salaries, and other subjects relating to the business of this office, the one dated 18th January and 1st February, 1808, addressed to the Secretary of War, and by him submitted to the committee of the House of Representatives on Indian affairs; one other, dated 16th January, 1809, and addressed to the Honorable Mr. Newton, Chairman of the Committee of Commerce and Manufactures of the same body, at their next session; and one other, dated 29th January, 1810, to the Secretary of the Treasury. As to the state of the trading fund, it is not practicable, while the business is actually going on at so many different and distant points, to make up, at any 'given period, an accurate account; all that can be done on this subject has been now attempted, to shew, by the last accounts received, and by estimates of property on hand, of uncertain value, of the dents due, and of unsettled accounts, the probable state of this fund. The general statement sent herewith, having reference to various abstracts annexed, for particulars, comprehends all the property and cash on hand, as well at the factories, and in the hands of agents, at other places, as at this office; deductions by estimate, for losses, being first made, leave, for the probable amount of the fund, as existing on the 31st December last? $235,461 64 cents. The amount of the capital stock employed, is not shewn by any books or documents in this office. The business of the trading houses haying been, previous to the year 1806, conducted by the purveyor of the public supplies, and others, under the direction of the Secretary of War, the books and documents relating to them have been but partially deposited with the Superintendent of Indian Trade. But, considering the amount of the different appropriations to the trading fund to be $300,000, and that the whole of this has been drawn from the treasury, and placed, from time to time, in the hands of the public agents, for the . purpose of Indian trade, except $20,000 of the appropriations of the last year, as is believed to be the fact, the capital stock, wherewith is to be compared the estimate of the present state of the fund now submitted, will be $280,000; and that estimate, amounting to $235,461 64 cents, the probable diminution will appear to have been $44,538 36 cents, since the commencement of the establishment. With very great respect, I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant, J. MASON. The Hon. Joseph Anderson, Chairman of the Committee of the Senate on Indian Affairs. The following statement exhibits the amount of property on hand, belonging to the United States' Indian 'Trading House Establishment, (as more particularly shewn by the abstracts referred to) on the 31s/ December, 1809.

There is an unsettled account with the War Department, for articles occasionally furnished to this establishment, on one side, and, on the other, for goods furnished and debts given in at Indian treaties. The balance is not believed to be against this office. A.

The furs and peltries forwarded from Arkansas to Mr. Saul,   m the 26th December, had not reached him on the 31st of that month: but. as they have been received by him since, and are not included in the account of property on hand at the factory, at that date, it was thought proper to      65,017 69 add them to this estimate. Note. It is to be remarked, that all the above peltries are carried out in money    at the prices at which they were taken in at the different factories, and that the practice in traffic with Indians is. to allow good prices for skins, and to obtain the rate of barter intended, by putting on the adequate advance on the goods furnished them: from this circumstance, and because great part of them have been on hand for want ol a market, from one to two years, much damage may be expected;      06,007 07 a reduction of at least forty per cent, may be estimated on the amount. ?39,010 62 —— 1810.] TRADING HOUSES. 773 E.

Sir: Understanding that a committee of Congress have been appointed on the subject of Indian affairs, I beg leave to submit to your consideration some alterations which appear to me to be requisite in the law regulating the trading house establishment. liy this law, it is not permitted to export, on public account, either furs or peltries. Experience, as the books and correspondence of my predecessor will show, has proven that the demand for peltries, particularly deer skins, of which great numbers, in our trade with the Indians, are, of necessity, taken, is by no means equal to the quantities furnished; of course, if restricted to be sold here, great sacrilices must be made, and such as must, in spite of every vigilance, on the part of the superintendent and the agents, inevitably diminish the fund set apart lor this trade. Although it is believed that the demand for furs, commonly used by hatters, in the manufactory of hats, is sufficient, in this country, to afford reasonable competition and sales, yet the existing restrictions to hold not less than six public sales in each year, and not more than two thereof in any one State, operate much against the fund, as thereby the President has it not in his power to select that market in the United States at which may have been found the greatest demand and best prices, as was evinced by the sales of the last year. The law authorizes the President to draw, annually, from the treasury, a sum not exceeding ten thousand dollars, for the payment of the agents and their clerks, at the different trading houses, and allow the agents to draw from the public supplies two rations each, and their clerks one ration each, per diem. This has been commuted to subsistence money, anti is paid at this office. There are now established on the frontiers ten trading houses, having one agent and one assistant at each. The salaries stand thus: 10 agents, 1 at $1,250, 9 at $1,000, per annum Subsistence money to each, a $365, per annum -Allowance, annually, for furniture, a $25 -10 assistants, at $600, per annum - - - - - Subsistence money, a $180, per annum Interpreters at most of the posts are indispensably requisite—say 7, at $100, per annum ------ Occasional interpreting at other pests—say - $10,250 3,650 250 6,000 1,800 2,800 250 $25,000 Thus it appears that a sum of not less than twenty-five thousand dollars is requisite for paying the salaries at the trading houses. The clerk hire allowed by the law, for this office, is one thousand dollars, annually. It is impossible to do the business with less than two good clerks. This, I believe, will be readily admitted, when it is recollected that the superintendent has to do, at this time, with ten different trading houses, (and their number will probably be increased) that he has not only to correspond with, but to supply them with goods from time to time, to receive and sell their peltries, to receive and settle their accounts quarterly, and to keep an extensive set of books, and a considerable correspondence with others, on the business of this establishment. Two clerks cannot be had for less than sixteen hundred dollars; and this rate is certainly moderate, when compared with the rate of clerk hire allowed in the other public offices: and it is to be remembered, that the clerks of this office are restricted from any trade or commerce, which is not the case with those in any of the other offices. If the number of trading houses are extended, more aid here will yet be necessary. At this time I have but one clerk engaged; and the fact is, with my whole time, 1 am not thus able to keep the business of the office from going behind hand. As to the propriety of extending the privilege of franking letters and packets, to this office, you, sir, who have witnessed their number and frequency, in passing through your Department, and the inconvenience attending the present mode of conducting the correspondence, can best judge. With very great respect, I have the honor to be, &c. &c. J. MASON, Superintendent of Indian Trade. General Henry Dearborn, Secretary of JVar, Washington. Office Indian Trade., lsi February, 1808. Sir: In ihe letter which I had the honor to write you on the 18th ultimo, the annual compensation to the agents and assistant agents, at the different trading houses, is said to stand thus: 9 agents, at $1,000 each; 1 at $1,250; subsistence money to each, $365; 10 assistant agents, at $600; subsistence money to each, $180. This statement, which was taken from one made by my predecessor, I found in the office, and was supposed, at the time, by me, to contain the actual sums now paid. On more strict examination, I find it was conjectural only of what would probably be the settled rates of compensation. The rates, now actually paid, are, 1 agent, $1,250 salary, and $365 subsistence money; 8 agents, $1,000 salary, and $365 subsistence money; and I agent, $750 salary, anil $270 subsistence money; 1 assistant agent, $600 salary, and $180 subsistence money; 2 assistant agents $500 salary, and $180 subsistence money; 5 assistant agents, at $500 salary, and $150 subsistence money. There appears to be two factories, at this time, without assistant agents.(«) Although the variation is not considerable, I consider it right to state the fact. The want of accuracy, in tint first statement, I pray may be attributed to the true cause, that, from the short time I have been in office, and with but slender aid,1 have not been, as yet, able to examine all the papers and accounts belonging to this establishment. With great respect, I am, sir, &c. Sic. J. MASON, Superintendent of Indian Trade. The Honorable Henry Dearborn, Secretary of JVar.

Sm: By instructions from the Secretary of War. to communicate to you such information as may have been acquired at this office, as to the operation of the act for establishing trading houses with the Indian tribes, I take the liberty to adress you. By this act it is not permitted to export furs or peltries. Experience has proven, that the home demand for peltries, particularly deer skins, (of which great numbers are, of necessity, taken from the Indians) is by no means equal to the quantity furnished; of course, if restricted to be sold here, great sacrifices will often be made. For furs commonly used by hatters, in the manufacture of hats, it is believed the demand in this country is sufficient to afford reasonable competition and sales, but the existing restrictions operate much against the fund, by narrowing the choice even among our own markets. It appears to have been contemplated by the present law, to pay from the treasury the salaries requisite to conduct this establishment, and, by not taxing the fund therewith, to give the Indians their supplies on bet ter terms. The increase of the business, by adding to the number of the trading houses, and spreading more extensively the benefits of the system among the various tribes, has, however, in part, compelled a departure from this plan, and occasioned heavy draughts from the funds. The law authorizes the President to draw from the treasury, annually, a sum not exceeding ten thousand dollars, for the payment of the salaries of agents and their clerks on the frontiers, and allow them to draw rations from the public supplies. These (the rations) have been commuted into subsistence money, which is paid from the funds of this establishment. There are, at this time, located and supplied on the frontiers, twelve trading houses, elven of which are in full operation, and one will commence as soon as the spring opens: of these, three have been established during the last year. The salaries now paid for conducting them, are: To agents, 8, at each, SI.000 per annum, and $365 per annum subsistence money. - - - $10,920 3, at $800, and $365 subsistence money, ------- 3,495 1, at $750. and $270 subsistence money, ------- 1,020 To assistant agents or clerks, 1 at $600 per annum, and $180 subsistence money. - - - 780 1 at $500, and $180 subsistence money, - - - - 680 5 at $500, and $150 subsistence money. - - - - 3,250 $20,145 Interpreters are requisite at most of the posts; the average rate of salary is $400 per annum, say, at 8 posts, 3,200 It will be seen, by the statement above, that, of the 12 factories. 7 only have assistant agents or clerks. 3 additional will probably be wanting, at $650, - 1,950 $25,295 The allowance for clerks for this office, payable from the treasury, is one thousand dollars per annum. Fourteen hundred dollars are paid, of which four hundred dollars from the funds of this establishment, as in the case of the agents at the trading houses. An additional accounting clerk is indispensably requisite, as the business of the office cannot be kept up with the present assistance; should it, therefore, be thought right to appropriate from the treasury enough to cover the annual expenses of agents, clerks, and assistants, twenty-five thousand three hundred dollars for the trading houses on the frontiers, and two thousand four hundred for this office, will be requisite. Whether it will be necessary to add to the general fund for the purposes of trade with the Indian tribes, depend -ing, in a great measure, on the policy of extending the system, it is not for me to give an opinion: it is, however, proper to remark, that the last has been an unfortunate year for the establishment, as well that the peltries depending for sale on foreign demand, are a dead and perishing stock on hand, as that most of the articles usually laid in for the supplies of the factories, have risen considerably in price. From the nature of the business of this office, you will readily see, sir, that the correspondence must be constant and extensive; and I beg to submit to you the propriety of extending the privilege of franking to it, as to other public offices. With very great respect, 1 have the honor to be. &e. &c. J. MASON, Superintendent of Indian Trade. The Honorable Thomas Newton, Chairman of the Committee of Commerce and Manufactures. Indian Trade Oi fice, 29//i January, 1S10. Sir: Having remarked, in the list of appropriations lately reported to Congress for the present year, no provision for an additional clerk in this office, as allowed by an act of the last session of the tenth Congress, which, I presume, may have escaped your notice, from the circumstance of its having been inserted in an act separate from that in which other appropriations for the office were made, I respectfully beg permission to draw your attention to the subject. The allowance for clerks for this office, by the original act of 1806, is $1,000; three clerks are employed: Jeremiah W. Bronaugh, at --------- - $800 John Fowler, ----------- - 800 And Meade Fitzhugh, ------- - - 600 $2,200 Four hundred dollars of which are paid out of the general fund. It is not reasonable to expect, that the gentlemen whose services are now employed, can long be retained, or other sufficient clerks be had at those rates, when ir is considered that the compensation paid here to the principal clerks, is not more than is received in the other public offices, by mere transcribers; and when, too, it is peculiarly the case in this office, that they are restrained from doing any business of a mercantile nature on their ow n accounts, it must happen, that none but young men can be employed,and that, as soon as they hano. ve become sufficiently acquainted with the business to be really useful, they w ill find better offers elsewhere, and may often leave the office in an awkward situation. Again, the responsibility of the clerks of this office is greater than in many others, because of the quantity of goods constantly packing and un-rir charge. The business of this office has increased much, by the addi- packing, receiving, and sending off, in their charge. The business of this oifice has no. increased much, by tion of new trading bouses. A principal clerk, of competent knowledge of business generally, and of goods suited to the trade particularly, a complete book keeper, and a transcribing clerk, are indispensably necessary. I therefore take the liberty to solicit, that an allowance of clerk hire be made, (including the 1,000 dollars appropriated by the act of 1806) of two thousand nine hundred dollars, and I beg leave, sir, to submit to your consideration the propriety of asking of Congress an appropriation to that effect. With very great respect, &c. &c. The Honorable Aluert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury. J. MASON, Superintendent of Indian Trade. 3 2th Congress.]
