It is discretionary with you to stipulate in what manner the consideration shall be paid, whether in a gross sum, payable after the ratification of the treaty, by instalments, or in an annuity for years, or perpetuity, or, partly, in both these modes, as you may deem most expedient. The payment by instalments is preferred. For the expenses attending the treaty, or treaties, you will draw on this Department, except for the provisions, which you will require of the contractor, unless some other person will agree to furnish them below contract price. Resides reasonable expenses,you will be allowed six dollars per day;aud the secretary to the commission, should one be necessary, three dollars per day, while actually employed.
