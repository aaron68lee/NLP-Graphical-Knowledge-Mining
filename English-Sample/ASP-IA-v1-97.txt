No. 97. [1st Session. THE SIX NATIONS. communicated to the senate, march 10, 1802. Gentlemen of the Senate: The Governor of New York lias desired that, in addition to the negotiations with certain Indians, already authorized, under the superintendence of John Taylor, further negotiations should be held with the Oneidas, and other members of the confederacy of the Six Nations, for the purchase of lands in, and for, the State of New York, which they are willing to sell, as explained in the letter from the Secretary of M ar, herewith sent. 1 have, therefore, thought it better to name a commissioner to superintend the negotiations specified, with the Six Nations, generally, or with any of them. I do, accordingly, nominate Joint Taylcr. of New York, to be commissioner for the United States, to hold a convention or conventions between the State of New York and the confederacy of the Six Nations of Indians, or any of the nations composing it. This nomination, if advised and consented to by the Senate, will comprehend and supersede that of February l.-t, of the same John Tayler. so far as it resuected the Seneca Indians. TIL JEFFERSON. March 0//i. 1802. War Department, 5th March. 1802. Sir: Governor Clinton, by his letter of the 00th ultimo, requests that a commissioner, on the part of the United States, might be appointed to attend a treaty with the Oneida Indians, for the purchase of about ten thousand acres of land, which that nation is desirous of selling, and which has, heretofore, been leased out to white people. 'The Six Nations have also expressed a wish to dispose of a narrow strip of land, which they consider as useless to them, bordering on Niagara river, and a small tract near the former Cayuga settlement. Accept, sir, the assurance of my high respect and consideration. II. DEARBORN. The President of the United States. * I 7lh Congress.]
