NO.185 PROVISION FOR TREATING WITH THE CHEROKEES. COMMUNICATED TO THE SENATE, MARCH 1, 1822. [To the Senate of the United States:	WASHINGTON, February 25, 1822. Under the appropriation made by the act of Congress of the 11th of April, 1820, for holding treaties with the Creek and Cherokee nations of Indians, for the extinguishment of the Indian title to lands within the State of Georgia, pursuant to the fourth condition of the first article of the articles of agreement and cession concluded between the United States and the State of Georgia on the 24th day of April, 1802, a treaty was held with the Creek nation, the expense of which, upon the settlement of the accounts of the commissioners who were appointed to conduct the negotiation, was ascertained to amount to the sum of $24,695, leaving an unexpended balance of the sum appropriated of $5,305â€”a sum too small to negotiate a treaty with the Cherokees, as was contemplated by the act making the appropriation. The Legislature of Georgia being still desirous that a treaty should be held for further extinguishment of the Indian title to lands within that State, and to obtain an indemnity to the citizens of that State for property of considerable value which has been taken from them by the Cherokee Indians, I submit the subject to the consideration of Congress, that a further sum, which, in addition to the balance of the former appropriation, will be adequate to the expenses attending a treaty with them, may be appropriated, should Congress deem it expedient. JAMES MONROE. CONGRESS.]
