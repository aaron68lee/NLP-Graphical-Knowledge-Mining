NO. 164.	[1st SESSION. EXTINGUISHMENT OF THE INDIAN TITLE TO LAND IN GEORGIA. COMMUNICATED TO THE SENATE, MARCH 20, 1820. To the Senate of the United States:	WASHINGTON, March 17, 1820. It being stipulated by the fourth article of the articles of agreement and cession entered into on the 24th of April, 1802, with the State of Georgia, that the United States should, at their own expense, extinguish for the use of that State, as soon as it might be done on reasonable terms, the Indian title to al) lands within its limits; and the Legislature of Georgia being desirous of making a further acquisition of said lands at this time, presuming that it may be done on reasonable terms; and it being, also, represented that property of considerable value had been taken by the Creek and Cherokee Indians from citizens of Georgia, the restoration of which had been provided for by different treaties, but which has never been made: it is proposed to hold a treaty with those nations, and more particularly with the Creeks, in the course of this summer, for the attainment of these objects. I submit the subject to the consideration of Congress, that a sum adequate to the expense attending such treaty may be appropriated, should Congress deem it expedient. 16th CONGRESS.]
