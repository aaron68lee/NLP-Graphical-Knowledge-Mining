NO. 141 CREEK GRANT TO GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON AND OTHERS. [1ST SESSION. COMMUNICATED TO THE SENATE, JANUARY 19, 1816. To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:	JANUARY 18, 1816. The accompanying extract from the occurrences at Fort Jackson in August, 1814, during the negotiation of a treaty with the Indians, shows that the friendly Creeks, wishing to give to General Jackson, Benjamin Hawkins, and others, a national mark of their gratitude and regard, conveyed to them, respectively, a donation of land, with a request that the grant might be duly confirmed by the Government of the United States. Taking into consideration the peculiar circumstances of the case, the expediency of indulging the Indians in wishes which they associated with the treaty signed by them, and that the case involves an inviting opportunity for bestowing on an officer who has rendered such illustrious services to his country a token of its sensibility to them, the inducement to which cannot be diminished by the delicacy and disinterestedness of his proposal to transfer the benefit from himself, I recommend to Congress that provision be made for carrying into effect the wishes and request of the Indians as expressed by them. JAMES MADISON. [NOTE.—For the “ extract,” see Indian Affairs, vol. i, page 837.] 14th CONGRESS.]
