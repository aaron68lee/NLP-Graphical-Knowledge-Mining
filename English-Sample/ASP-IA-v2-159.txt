NO. 159 CLAIM OF THE CREEKS. [COMMUNICATED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, JANUARY 18, 1819. SIR:	DEPARTMENT OF WAR, January 16, 1819. In compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 4th instant, directing the Secretary of War “ to lay before the House such information as he may possess respecting the adjustment of the. claims of the friendly Creek Indians, made in consideration of their treaty with the United States of the 9th August, 1814,” I have the honor to transmit a copy of a letter addressed by General D. B. Mitchell, agent to the Creek Indians, to this Department, accompanied by a statement of the sums paid by him to satisfy the claims of the frigndly Creek Indians for the property destroyed by the hostile Creek Indians during the war which was terminated by the treaty of the 9th of August, 1814; and an extract of a letter addressed by the War Department to General Mitchell; which contain all the information in possession of the Department on that subject. I have the honor to be your most obedient servant, J. C. CALHOUN. The Hon. the SPEAKER of the House of Representatives. SIR:	CREEK AGENCY, March 18, 1818. I have now the honor to enclose a concise statement of the accounts presented by the friendly Indians for losses during the late war, and of the application of the sum appropriated by Congress for their payment, by which it appears that a little upwards of $100,000 is still due. The gross amount of claims presented, including the abstract made by Colonel Hawkins, is very little over or under $300,000; but they were reduced by the chiefs to $195,417 90. A general abstract of the whole will be forwarded as soon as completed. Eighty-three thousand dollars of the amount appropriated having been remitted in drafts upon the United States Bank in Philadelphia, I went to Savannah, and presented them to the officers of the branch of that bank established there, but they refused to take them up. I then returned and consulted the chiefs, and they agreed to allow two and a half per cent., that being the lowest rate of exchange between Philadelphia and Savannah, or Augusta, at that time, rather than be delayed, or risk the conveyance of so large a sum by an agent. The remaining $2,000 was paid to McIntosh in Washington. I am yours, &c. D. B. MITCHELL, Agent for Indian Affairs. Hon. J. C. CALHOUN, Secretary of War.
